              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Emerging approaches for decoding neuropeptide transmission</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides produce robust effects on behavior across species, and recent research has benefited from advances in high-resolution techniques to investigate peptidergic transmission and expression throughout the brain in model systems. Neuropeptides exhibit distinct characteristics which includes their post-translational processing, release from dense core vesicles, and ability to activate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These complex properties have driven the need for development of specialized tools that can sense neuropeptide expression, cell activity, and release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Removal of pomt1 in zebrafish leads to loss of α-dystroglycan glycosylation and dystroglycanopathy phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Biallelic mutations in Protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) are among the most common causes of a severe group of congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) known as dystroglycanopathies. POMT1 is a glycosyltransferase responsible for the attachment of a functional glycan mediating interactions between the transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan and its binding partners in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Disruptions in these cell-ECM interactions lead to multiple developmental defects causing brain and eye malformations in addition to CMD. Removing Pomt1 in the mouse leads to early embryonic death due to the essential role of dystroglycan in embryo implantation in rodents. Here, we characterized and validated a model of pomt1 loss of function in the zebrafish showing that developmental defects found in individuals affected by dystroglycanopathies can be recapitulated in the fish. We also discovered that pomt1 mRNA provided by the mother in the oocyte supports dystroglycan glycosylation during the first few weeks of development. Muscle disease, retinal synapse formation deficits, and axon guidance defects can only be uncovered during the first week post-fertilization by generating knock-out embryos from knock-out mothers. Conversely, maternal pomt1 from heterozygous mothers was sufficient to sustain muscle, eye, and brain development only leading to detectable muscle disease and loss of photoreceptor synapses at 30 days post fertilization. Our findings show that it is important to define the contribution of maternal mRNA while developing zebrafish models of dystroglycanopathies and that offspring generated from heterozygous and knock-out mothers can be used to differentiate the role of dystroglycan glycosylation in tissue formation and maintenance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Building Transformers from Neurons and Astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells account for roughly 90% of all human brain cells, and serve a variety of important developmental, structural, and metabolic functions. Recent experimental efforts suggest that astrocytes, a type of glial cell, are also directly involved in core cognitive processes such as learning and memory. While it is well-established that astrocytes and neurons are connected to one another in feedback loops across many time scales and spatial scales, there is a gap in understanding the computational role of neuron-astrocyte interactions. To help bridge this gap, we draw on recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and astrocyte imaging technology. In particular, we show that neuron-astrocyte networks can naturally perform the core computation of a Transformer, a particularly successful type of AI architecture. In doing so, we provide a concrete and experimentally testable account of neuron-astrocyte communication. Because Transformers are so successful across a wide variety of task domains, such as language, vision, and audition, our analysis may help explain the ubiquity, flexibility, and power of the brain's neuron-astrocyte networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual experience instructs the organization of cortical feedback inputs to primary visual cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Cortical feedback (FB) projections are thought to modulate lower-order activity depending on learned expectations. However, whether FB inputs become bound to specific lower-order neurons depending on experience is unknown. We measured the effects of dark rearing and manipulations of experienced visual statistics on the retinotopic specificity of projections from the lateromedial (LM) visual area to layer 1 of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). LM inputs were, on average, retinotopically matched with V1 neurons irrespective of visual experience. While the orientation tuning of LM axons determined the retinotopic position of the V1 neurons they innervated, this organization was absent in dark-reared mice. Restricting visual experience to a narrow range of orientations revealed that visual experience exerts an instructive role in the retinotopic organization of LM inputs in V1. Our observations support theories of hierarchical computation proposing that inputs from higher-order neurons to lower-order ones reflect learned hierarchical associations.

	<p>The brain is susceptible to perturbations of redox balance, affecting neurogenesis and increasing the risks of psychiatric disorders. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is an endogenous inhibitor of the thioredoxin antioxidant system. Its deletion or inhibition suggests protection for a brain with ischemic stroke or Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Combined with conditional knockout mice and schizophrenia samples, we aimed to investigate the function of TXNIP in healthy brain and psychiatric disorders, which are under-studied. We found TXNIP was remarkedly expressed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during healthy mice&amp;amp;rsquo;s prenatal and early postnatal periods, whereas it rapidly decreased throughout adulthood. During early life, TXNIP was primarily distributed in inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Contrary to the protective effect, the embryonic deletion of TXNIP in GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic) neurons enhanced oxidative stress in PV+ interneurons of aging mice. The deleterious impact was brain region-specific. We also investigated the relationship between TXNIP and schizophrenia. TXNIP was significantly increased in the PFC of schizophrenia-like mice after MK801 administration, followed by oxidative stress. First episode and drug na&amp;amp;iuml;ve schizophrenia patients with a higher level of plasma TXNIP displayed severer psychiatric symptoms than patients with a low level. We indicated a bidirectional function of TXNIP in the brain, whose high expression in the early stage is protective for development but might be harmful in a later period, associated with mental disorders.</p>

	<p>Brain decoding is to predict the external stimulus information from the collected brain response activities, and visual information is one of the most important sources of external stimulus information. Decoding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on visual stimulation is helpful in understanding the working mechanism of the brain visual function regions. Traditional brain decoding algorithms cannot accurately extract stimuli features from fMRI. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposed a brain decoding algorithm based on a graph convolution network (GCN). Firstly, 11 regions of interest (ROI) were selected according to the human brain visual function regions, which can avoid the noise interference of the non-visual regions of the human brain; then, a deep three-dimensional convolution neural network was specially designed to extract the features of these 11 regions; next, the GCN was used to extract the functional correlation features between the different human brain visual regions. Furthermore, to avoid the problem of gradient disappearance when there were too many layers of graph convolutional neural network, the residual connections were adopted in our algorithm, which helped to integrate different levels of features in order to improve the accuracy of the proposed GCN. The proposed algorithm was tested on the public dataset, and the recognition accuracy reached 98.67%. Compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm performed the best.</p>

	<p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective therapy for many psychiatric illnesses. However, intracranial occupying lesions are a relative contraindication to ECT. Arachnoid cysts are benign, congenital, and space-occupying lesions. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ECT in psychiatric patients with arachnoid cysts. We retrospectively identified 62 psychiatric patients with arachnoid cysts; 43 of them underwent ECT and 19 did not. Their conditions were assessed by CGI-S and different scales depending on different diagnoses (PANSS for schizophrenia; HAMD for depression; YMRS for bipolar disorder). The side effect was assessed by TESS. Significant differences were shown in the reduced scores of the CGI-S between patients who underwent ECT and those who did not (p = 0.001), while, at the same time, there was no significant difference in their TESS score (p = 0.297). The current study found that ECT is an effective and tolerable therapy for psychiatric patients with arachnoid cysts.</p>

<p>The number of cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) positive cell in the brain varies along life span of female C57BL/6J mice, whose patterns can be clustered into 9 catagories indicating possible correlation among the brain regions. The dynamics of CB<sub>1</sub>R positive cell number along life span may partially be responsible to disease suceptability in different ages in female.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Many brain functions that underlie behavior, cognition, and emotions vary with age, as does susceptibility to neuropsychological disorders. The expression of specific genes that are involved in these functions, such as the genes encoding for oxytocin, its receptors, and apolipoprotein D, varies with age across different brain regions. The cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) is one of the most widely spread G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system and is increasingly recognized for its important contribution to various brain functions. Although changes in CB<sub>1</sub>R expression with age have been reported in the male mouse brain, they have not been well investigated in the female brain. Here, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization to target CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA in the whole brains of female C57BL/6J mice aged 4, 6, 12, 52 (12 months) and 86 weeks (20 months), and quantified CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells in 36 brain regions across the whole brain. The results showed that CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells number changed with age. Specifically, CB<sub>1</sub>R expression increased with age in some subregions of the cortex, decreased with age in the lateral septal area, and reached its lowest level at 52 weeks in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and hindbrain subregions. Cluster analysis revealed that some brain regions shared similar temporal characteristics in CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive cell number across the lifespan. Our results provide evidence that investigation of the neural basis of age-related characteristics of female brain functions is not only warranted but required.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modulation of signaling cross-talk between pJNK and pAKT generates optimal apoptotic response</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sharmila Biswas, Baishakhi Tikader, Sandip Kar, Ganesh A. Viswanathan</p>

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a well-known modulator of apoptosis by maintaining a balance between proliferation and cell-death in normal cells. Cancer cells often evade apoptotic response following TNFα stimulation by altering signaling cross-talks. Thus, varying the extent of signaling cross-talk could enable optimal TNFα mediated apoptotic dynamics. Herein, we use an experimental data-driven mathematical modeling to quantitate the extent of synergistic signaling cross-talk between the intracellular entities phosphorylated JNK (pJNK) and phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) that orchestrate the phenotypic apoptosis level by modulating the activated Caspase3 dynamics. Our study reveals that this modulation is orchestrated by the distinct dynamic nature of the synergism at early and late phases. We show that this synergism in signal flow is governed by branches originating from either TNFα receptor and NFκB, which facilitates signaling through survival pathways. We demonstrate that the experimentally quantified apoptosis levels semi-quantitatively correlates with the model simulated Caspase3 transients. Interestingly, perturbing pJNK and pAKT transient dynamics fine-tunes this accumulated Caspase3 guided apoptotic response. Thus, our study offers useful insights for identifying potential targeted therapies for optimal apoptotic response.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A deep learning approach to real-time HIV outbreak detection using genetic data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael D. Kupperman, Thomas Leitner, Ruian Ke</p>

Pathogen genomic sequence data are increasingly made available for epidemiological monitoring. A main interest is to identify and assess the potential of infectious disease outbreaks. While popular methods to analyze sequence data often involve phylogenetic tree inference, they are vulnerable to errors from recombination and impose a high computational cost, making it difficult to obtain real-time results when the number of sequences is in or above the thousands.
Here, we propose an alternative strategy to outbreak detection using genomic data based on deep learning methods developed for image classification. The key idea is to use a pairwise genetic distance matrix calculated from viral sequences as an image, and develop convolutional neutral network (CNN) models to classify areas of the images that show signatures of active outbreak, leading to identification of subsets of sequences taken from an active outbreak. We showed that our method is efficient in finding HIV-1 outbreaks with <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> ≥ 2.5, and overall a specificity exceeding 98% and sensitivity better than 92%. We validated our approach using data from HIV-1 CRF01 in Europe, containing both endemic sequences and a well-known dual outbreak in intravenous drug users. Our model accurately identified known outbreak sequences in the background of slower spreading HIV. Importantly, we detected both outbreaks early on, before they were over, implying that had this method been applied in real-time as data became available, one would have been able to intervene and possibly prevent the extent of these outbreaks. This approach is scalable to processing hundreds of thousands of sequences, making it useful for current and future real-time epidemiological investigations, including public health monitoring using large databases and especially for rapid outbreak identification.

    Phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been developed to overcome the low efficiency of fluorescent OLEDs. However, device instability, originating from triplet excitons and polarons, limits blue OLED applications. Here, we develop a phosphor-sensitized TADF emission system with TADF emitters to achieve high efficiency and long operational lifetime. Peripheral carbazole moieties are introduced in conventional multi-resonance–type emitters containing one boron atom. The triplet exciton density of the TADF emitter is reduced by facilitating reverse intersystem crossing, and the Förster resonant energy transfer rate from phosphor sensitizer is enhanced by high absorption coefficient of the emitters. The emitter exhibited an operational lifetime of 72.9 hours with Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage chromaticity coordinate

    The central idea of metamaterials and metaoptics is that, besides their base materials, the geometry of structures offers a broad extra dimension to explore for exotic functionalities. Here, we discover that the topology of structures fundamentally dictates the topological properties of optical fields and offers a new dimension to exploit for optical functionalities that are irrelevant to specific material constituents or structural geometries. We find that the nontrivial topology of metal structures ensures the birth of polarization singularities (PSs) in the near field with rich morphologies and intriguing spatial evolutions including merging, bifurcation, and topological transition. By mapping the PSs to non-Hermitian exceptional points and using homotopy theory, we extract the core invariant that governs the topological classification of the PSs and the conservation law that regulates their spatial evolutions. The results bridge singular optics, topological photonics, and non-Hermitian physics, with potential applications in chiral sensing, chiral quantum optics, and beyond photonics in other wave systems.

    Understanding the growth mechanism of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and achieving selective growth requires insights into the catalyst structure-function relationship. Using an in situ aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscope, we reveal the effects of the state and structure of catalysts on the growth modes of SWCNTs. SWCNTs grown from molten catalysts via a vapor-liquid-solid process generally present similar diameters to those of the catalysts, indicating a size correlation between nanotubes and catalysts. However, SWCNTs grown from solid catalysts via a vapor-solid-solid process always have smaller diameters than the catalysts, namely, an independent relationship between their sizes. The diameter distribution of SWCNTs grown from crystalline Co

    , which has a unique atomic arrangement, is discrete. In contrast, nanotubes obtained from crystalline Co are randomly dispersed. The different growth modes are linked to the distinct chiral selectivity of SWCNTs grown on intermetallic and monometallic catalysts. These findings will enable rational design of catalysts for chirality-controlled SWCNTs growth.

    Cellulose, a renewable structural biopolymer, is ubiquitous in nature and is the basic reinforcement component of the natural hierarchical structures of living plants, bacteria, and tunicates. However, a detailed picture of the crystalline cellulose surface at the molecular level is still unavailable. Here, using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we revealed the molecular details of the cellulose chain arrangements on the surfaces of individual cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) in water. Furthermore, we visualized the three-dimensional (3D) local arrangement of water molecules near the CNC surface using 3D AFM. AFM experiments and MD simulations showed anisotropic water structuring, as determined by the surface topologies and exposed chemical moieties. These findings provide important insights into our understanding of the interfacial interactions between CNCs and water at the molecular level. This may allow the establishment of the structure-property relationship of CNCs extracted from various biomass sources.

    Capturing cell-to-cell signals in a three-dimensional (3D) environment is key to studying cellular functions. A major challenge in the current culturing methods is the lack of accurately capturing multicellular 3D environments. In this study, we established a framework for 3D bioprinting plant cells to study cell viability, cell division, and cell identity. We established long-term cell viability for bioprinted Arabidopsis and soybean cells. To analyze the generated large image datasets, we developed a high-throughput image analysis pipeline. Furthermore, we showed the cell cycle reentry of bioprinted cells for which the timing coincides with the induction of core cell cycle genes and regeneration-related genes, ultimately leading to microcallus formation. Last, the identity of bioprinted Arabidopsis root cells expressing endodermal markers was maintained for longer periods. The framework established here paves the way for a general use of 3D bioprinting for studying cellular reprogramming and cell cycle reentry toward tissue regeneration.

Using well-controlled in vitro reconstitution systems, we demonstrated that IRSp53 clusters recruit the actin polymerase VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) to assemble actin filaments locally on membranes, leading to the generation of actin-filled membrane protrusions reminiscent of filopodia. By pulling membrane nanotubes from live cells, we observed that IRSp53 can only be enriched and trigger actin assembly in nanotubes at highly dynamic membrane regions. Our work supports a regulation mechanism of IRSp53 in its attributes of curvature sensation and partner recruitment to ensure a precise spatial-temporal control of filopodium initiation.

    Colonization of the host intestine is the most important step in
    <i>
     Vibrio cholerae
    </i>
    infection. The toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), an operon-encoded type IVb pilus (T4bP), plays a crucial role in this process, which requires an additional secreted protein, TcpF, encoded on the same TCP operon; however, its mechanisms of secretion and function remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated that TcpF interacts with the minor pilin, TcpB, of TCP and elucidated the crystal structures of TcpB alone and in complex with TcpF. The structural analyses reveal how TCP recognizes TcpF and its secretory mechanism via TcpB-dependent pilus elongation and retraction. Upon binding to TCP, TcpF forms a flower-shaped homotrimer with its flexible N terminus hooked onto the trimeric interface of TcpB. Thus, the interaction between the minor pilin and the N terminus of the secreted protein, namely, the T4bP secretion signal, is key for
    <i>
     V. cholerae
    </i>
    colonization and is a new potential therapeutic target.

    Optically levitated macroscopic objects are a powerful tool in the field of force sensing, owing to high sensitivity, absolute force calibration, environmental isolation, and the advanced degree of control over their dynamics that have been achieved. However, limitations arise from the spurious forces caused by electrical polarization effects that, even for nominally neutral objects, affect the force sensing because of the interaction of dipole moments with gradients of external electric fields. Here, we introduce a technique to measure, model, and eliminate dipole moment interactions, limiting the performance of sensors using levitated objects. This process leads to a noise-limited measurement with a sensitivity of 3.3 × 10

    Decades of structure-function studies have established our current extensive understanding of enzymes. However, traditional structural models are snapshots of broader conformational ensembles of interchanging states. We demonstrate the need for conformational ensembles to understand function, using the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) as an example. Comparison of prior KSI cryogenic x-ray structures suggested deleterious mutational effects from a misaligned oxyanion hole catalytic residue. However, ensemble information from room-temperature x-ray crystallography, combined with functional studies, excluded this model. Ensemble-function analyses can deconvolute effects from altering the probability of occupying a state (
    <i>
     P
    </i>
    -effects) and changing the reactivity of each state (
    <i>
     k
    </i>
    -effects); our ensemble-function analyses revealed functional effects arising from weakened oxyanion hole hydrogen bonding and substrate repositioning within the active site. Ensemble-function studies will have an integral role in understanding enzymes and in meeting the future goals of a predictive understanding of enzyme catalysis and engineering new enzymes.

   <div>
    How the germ line achieves a clean transition from maternal to zygotic gene expression control is a fundamental problem in sexually reproducing organisms. Whereas several mechanisms terminate the maternal program in the soma, this combined molecular reset and handover are poorly understood for primordial germ cells (PGCs). Here, we show that GRIF-1, a TRIM32-related and presumed E3 ubiquitin ligase in
    <i>
     Caenorhabditis elegans
    </i>
    , eliminates the maternal cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase (cytoPAP) complex by targeting the germline-specific intrinsically disordered region of its enzymatic subunit, GLD-2, for proteasome-mediated degradation. Interference with cytoPAP turnover in PGCs causes frequent transgenerational sterility and, eventually, germline mortality. Hence, positively acting maternal RNA regulators are cleared via the proteasome system to avoid likely interference between maternal and zygotic gene expression programs to maintain transgenerational fertility and acquire germline immortality. This strategy is likely used in all animals that preform their immortal germ line via maternally inherited germplasm determinants.

    Most patients with cancer are refractory to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, and proper patient stratification remains an open question. Primary patient data suffer from high heterogeneity, low accessibility, and lack of proper controls. In contrast, syngeneic mouse tumor models enable controlled experiments with ICB treatments. Using transcriptomic and experimental variables from &gt;700 ICB-treated/control syngeneic mouse tumors, we developed a machine learning framework to model tumor immunity and identify factors influencing ICB response. Projected on human immunotherapy trial data, we found that the model can predict clinical ICB response. We further applied the model to predicting ICB-responsive/resistant cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, which agreed well with existing clinical reports. Last, feature analysis implicated factors associated with ICB response. In summary, our computational framework based on mouse tumor data reliably stratified patients regarding ICB response, informed resistance mechanisms, and has the potential for wide applications in disease treatment studies.

Inhibition of non-muscle myosin II (NM II)–driven apical constriction altered ISC shape and reduced niche curvature and stem cell capacity. Niche curvature is decreased in aged mice, suggesting that suboptimal interactions between old ISCs and their niche develop with age. We show that activation of NM IIC or physical restriction to young topology improves in vitro regeneration by old epithelium. We propose that the increase in lateral surface area of ISCs induced by apical constriction promotes interactions between neighboring cells, and the curved topology of the intestinal niche has evolved to maximize signaling between ISCs and neighboring cells.

    Biomolecular condensates participate in diverse cellular processes, ranging from gene regulation to stress survival. Bottom-up engineering of synthetic condensates advances our understanding of the organizing principle of condensates. It also enables the synthesis of artificial systems with novel functions. However, building synthetic condensates with a predictable organization and function remains challenging. Here, we use DNA as a building block to create synthetic condensates that are assembled through phase separation. The programmability of intermolecular interactions between DNA molecules enables the control over various condensate properties including assembly, composition, and function. Similar to the way intracellular condensates are organized, DNA clients are selectively partitioned into cognate condensates. We demonstrate that the synthetic condensates can accelerate DNA strand displacement reactions and logic gate operation by concentrating specific reaction components. We envision that the DNA-based condensates could help the realization of the high-order functions required to build more life-like artificial systems.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the characteristics of participants with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in a trial of gantenerumab or solanezumab in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (DIAD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>142 DIAD mutation carriers received either gantenerumab SC (n = 52), solanezumab IV (n = 50), or placebo (n = 40). Participants underwent assessments with the Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®), neuropsychological testing, CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor ARIA. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses evaluated potential ARIA-related risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven participants developed ARIA-E, including 3 with mild symptoms. No ARIA-E was reported under solanezumab while gantenerumab was associated with ARIA-E compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 9.1, confidence interval [CI][1.2, 412.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.021). Under gantenerumab, <i>APOE-ɛ4</i> carriers were more likely to develop ARIA-E (OR = 5.0, CI[1.0, 30.4]; <i>p</i> = 0.055), as were individuals with microhemorrhage at baseline (OR = 13.7, CI[1.2, 163.2]; <i>p</i> = 0.039). No ARIA-E was observed at the initial 225 mg/month gantenerumab dose, and most cases were observed at doses &gt;675 mg. At first ARIA-E occurrence, all ARIA-E participants were amyloid-PET+, 60% were CDR &gt;0, 60% were past their estimated year to symptom onset, and 60% had also incident ARIA-H. Most ARIA-E radiologically resolved after dose adjustment and developing ARIA-E did not significantly increase odds of trial discontinuation. ARIA-E was more frequently observed in the occipital lobe (90%). ARIA-E severity was associated with age at time of ARIA-E.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In DIAD, solanezumab was not associated with ARIA. Gantenerumab dose over 225 mg increased ARIA-E risk, with additional risk for individuals <i>APOE-ɛ4(+)</i> or with microhemorrhage. ARIA-E was reversible on MRI in most cases, generally asymptomatic, without additional risk for trial discontinuation. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Anopheles homing suppression drive candidates exhibit unexpected performance differences in simulations with spatial structure</a></h4>

              
                Recent experiments have produced several <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> homing gene drives that disrupt female fertility genes, thereby eventually inducing population collapse. Such drives may be highly effective tools to combat malaria. One such homing drive, based on the <i>zpg</i> promoter driving CRISPR/Cas9, was able to eliminate a cage population of mosquitoes. A second version, purportedly improved upon the first by incorporating an X-shredder element (which biases inheritance towards male offspring), was similarly successful. Here, we analyze experimental data from each of these gene drives to extract their characteristics and performance parameters and compare these to previous interpretations of their experimental performance. We assess each suppression drive within an individual-based simulation framework that models mosquito population dynamics in continuous space. We find that the combined homing/X-shredder drive is actually less effective at population suppression within the context of our mosquito population model. In particular, the combined drive often fails to completely suppress the population, instead resulting in an unstable equilibrium between drive and wild-type alleles. By contrast, otherwise similar drives based on the <i>nos</i> promoter may prove to be more promising candidates for future development than originally thought.

                Mammalian axonal development begins in embryonic stages and continues postnatally. After birth, axonal proteomic landscape changes rapidly, coordinated by transcription, protein turnover, and post-translational modifications. Comprehensive profiling of axonal proteomes across neurodevelopment is limited, with most studies lacking cell-type and neural circuit specificity, resulting in substantial information loss. We create a Cre-dependent APEX2 reporter mouse line and map cell-type specific proteome of corticostriatal projections across postnatal development. We synthesize analysis frameworks to define temporal patterns of axonal proteome and phosphoproteome, identifying co-regulated proteins and phosphorylations associated with genetic risk for human brain disorders. We discover proline-directed kinases as major developmental regulators. APEX2 transgenic reporter proximity labeling offers flexible strategies for subcellular proteomics with cell type specificity in early neurodevelopment, a critical period for neuropsychiatric disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 is required for normal pyramidal cell–interneuron communication and assembly dynamics in the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                We interrogated prefrontal circuit function in mice lacking <i>Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1</i> (Disc1-mutant mice), a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Single-unit recordings in awake mice revealed reduced average firing rates of fast-spiking interneurons (INTs), including optogenetically identified parvalbumin-positive cells, and a lower proportion of INTs phase-coupled to ongoing gamma oscillations. Moreover, we observed decreased spike transmission efficacy at local pyramidal cell (PYR)-INT connections in vivo, suggesting a reduced excitatory effect of local glutamatergic inputs as a potential mechanism of lower INT rates. On the network level, impaired INT function resulted in altered activation of PYR assemblies: While assembly activations defined as coactivations within 25 ms were observed equally often, the expression strength of individual assembly patterns was significantly higher in Disc1-mutant mice. Our data, thus, reveal a role of Disc1 in shaping the properties of prefrontal assembly patterns by setting INT responsiveness to glutamatergic drive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Population spiking and bursting in next generation neural masses with spike-frequency adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) is a fundamental neuronal mechanism taking into account the fatigue due to spike emissions and the consequent reduction of the firing activity. We have studied the effect of this adaptation mechanism on the macroscopic dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons coupled via exponentially decaying post- synaptic potentials. In particular, we have studied the population activities by employing an exact mean field reduction, which gives rise to next generation neural mass models. This low-dimensional reduction allows for the derivation of bifurcation diagrams and the identification of the possible macroscopic regimes emerging both in a single and in two identically coupled neural masses. In single populations SFA favours the emergence of population bursts in excitatory networks, while it hinders tonic population spiking for inhibitory ones. The symmetric coupling of two neural masses, in absence of adaptation, leads to the emergence of macroscopic solutions with broken symmetry: namely, chimera-like solutions in the inhibitory case and anti-phase population spikes in the excitatory one. The addition of SFA leads to new collective dynamical regimes exhibiting cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among the fast synaptic time scale and the slow adaptation one, ranging from anti-phase slow-fast nested oscillations to symmetric and asymmetric bursting phenomena. The analysis of these CFC rhythms in the {theta}- {gamma} range has revealed that a reduction of SFA leads to an increase of the {theta} frequency joined to a decrease of the {gamma} one. This is analogous to what reported experimentally for the hippocampus and the olfactory cortex of rodents under cholinergic modulation, that is known to reduce SFA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic diversity of cell types across the adult human brain</a></h4>

              
                The human brain directs a wide range of complex behaviors ranging from fine motor skills to abstract intelligence and emotion. However, the diversity of cell types that support these skills has not been fully described. Here we used high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing to systematically survey cells across the entire adult human brain in three postmortem donors. We sampled over three million nuclei from approximately 100 dissections across the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Our analysis identified 461 clusters and 3313 subclusters organized largely according to developmental origins. We found area-specific cortical neurons, as well as an unexpectedly high diversity of midbrain and hindbrain neurons. Astrocytes also exhibited regional diversity at multiple scales, comprising subtypes specific to the telencephalon and to more precise anatomical locations. Oligodendrocyte precursors comprised two distinct major types specific to the telencephalon and to the rest of the brain. Together, these findings demonstrate the unique cellular composition of the telencephalon with respect to all major brain cell types. As the first single-cell transcriptomic census of the entire human brain, we provide a resource for understanding the molecular diversity of the human brain in health and disease.

                The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the immediate effects of Automatic Self-Transcending (AST) meditation on the cognitive function, EEG activity and autonomic arousal (Study 1) and characterize the frontal EEG synchrony during resting state, cognitive activity and AST mental states in traditional and wireless EEG's (Study 2). We report the results of three healthy AST meditation volunteers in this case-report study (Case 1 - age = 26 years, meditative practice time = 2 months; Case 2 - age = 39 years, meditative practice time = 6 years; Case 3 - age = 59 years, meditative practice time = 40 years). In study 1, the volunteers performed a protocol with simultaneous recording of EEG and skin conductance while performing the Stroop test (T0), followed by 20 minutes of AST meditation and immediately the same protocol performed at T0 (T1). We analyzed P300 amplitude and latency, as well as test behavioral response and skin conductance activity before and immediately after a single session of AST. In study 2, the same volunteers performed three tasks with eyes closed on two EEG equipment (traditional and wireless): resting state, cognitive activity and one session of AST, each for 20 minutes. We measured the frontal interhemispheric coherence of alpha1 (8-10 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) for each condition and EEG type. Our main findings show that there is an immediate beneficial effect after AST meditation at the level of the same individual with different patterns of P300 and skin conductance activity and that AST meditation is marked by an overall increase in the frontal coherence of alpha1 and beta bands, when compared to other mental states. We conclude that 1) there is an immediate effect on cognition and executive control after AST meditation, 2) the frontal interhemispheric coherence of alpha1 and beta bands are increased during AST, and 3) wireless EEG exhibits the same characteristics observed in traditional EEG and therefore can be used to describe cortical dynamics during AST.

                Even prior to producing their first words, infants are developing a sophisticated speech processing system, with robust word recognition present by 4-6 months of age. These emergent linguistic skills, observed with behavioural investigations, are likely to rely on increasingly sophisticated neural underpinnings. The infant brain is known to robustly track the speech envelope, however to date no cortical tracking study could investigate the emergence of phonetic feature encoding. Here we utilise temporal response functions computed from electrophysiological responses to nursery rhymes to investigate the cortical encoding of phonetic features in a longitudinal cohort of infants when aged 4, 7 and 11 months, as well as adults. The analyses reveal an increasingly detailed and acoustically-invariant phonetic encoding over the first year of life, providing the first direct evidence that the pre-verbal human cortex learns phonetic categories. By 11 months of age, however, infants still did not exhibit adult-like encoding.

                While the causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear, some studies have shown that serotonin-mediated effects on enteric nervous system (ENT) correlate with ASD-like behavioral phenotype in mice. Introduced here is a mathematical model of interactions between gut serotonin and its impact on ENT. The model was used to identify three key factors that affect ENT size, namely, serotonin production, its clearance, and its ability to act as a growth factor on ENT. The model was used to reproduce experimentally reported results from a mouse model by Margolis et al. (2016), which connected serotonin-mediated ENT hypoplasia to an ASD phenotype. The proposed mathematical model was used to scale the quantified relationship from mice to humans to show how the combination of these three factors can translate to a quantifiable metric that could potentially be correlated to ASD spectrum. A detailed discussion of how ENT hypoplasia could mechanistically affect CNS activity concludes this paper.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pre-saccadic neural enhancements in marmoset area MT mimic covert attention</a></h4>

              
                Each time we make a saccadic eye movement, attention moves before the eyes, resulting in a perceptual enhancement at the target of the movement (Kowler et al., 1995; Deubel & Schneider, 1996; Rolfs & Carrasco, 2012). Recent psychophysical studies suggest that this pre- saccadic attention may differ in important ways from covert attention when no eye movement is made (Li, Pan, & Carrasco, 2021a,b). One difference is that pre-saccadic attention involves an automatic enhancement concentrated around the features of the saccade target, such as its orientation, whereas spatial attention in covert attention enhances stimulus features uniformly (Li et al., 2016; Ohl et al., 2017). While previous neurophysiological studies have found that pre- saccadic attention enhances neural responses (Moore et al., 1998; Li & Basso, 2008; Moore & Chang, 2009; Steinmetz & Moore 2010; Merrikhi et al., 2021), no studies have tested for changes in tuning that would support a concentration of enhancement around target features. Here we examined pre-saccadic attention using a saccade foraging task developed for marmoset monkeys. We first establish that the marmoset monkey, like macaques, shows enhanced pre-saccadic neural responses in the middle temporal (MT) and middle temporal crescent (MTC) areas. To examine if changes in neural tuning might support feature enhancement, we fit an adjusted Von Mises function to the direction selective responses of neurons. Neurons exhibited diverse changes in tuning, but the predominant pattern was an additive and multiplicative increase in the tuning curve consistent with spatial gain. The changes in tuning predicted changes in neural sensitivity assessed by measures of mutual information with motion direction. Additive increases led to detriments in sensitivity while gain increases improved sensitivity. And although a subset of neurons did show a narrowing in tuning that could reflect feature-selection, there were equal number of neurons showing the opposite. Overall the modulation of neural responses during pre-saccadic attention appears highly consistent with previous studies of covert attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Macro-scale patterns in functional connectivity associated with ongoing thought patterns and dispositional traits</a></h4>

              
                Complex macro-scale patterns of brain activity that emerge during periods of wakeful rest provide insight into the organisation of neural function, how these differentiate individuals based on their traits, and the neural basis of different types of self-generated thoughts. Although brain activity during wakeful rest is valuable for understanding important features of human cognition, its unconstrained nature makes it difficult to disentangle neural features related to personality traits from those related to the thoughts occurring at rest. Our study builds on recent perspectives from work on ongoing conscious thought that highlight the interactions between three brain networks - ventral and dorsal attention networks, as well as the default mode network. We combined measures of personality with state-of-the-art indices of ongoing thoughts at rest and brain imaging analysis and explored whether this tripartite view can provide a framework within which to understand the contribution of states and traits to observed patterns of neural activity at rest. To capture macro-scale relationships between different brain systems, we calculated cortical gradients to describe brain organisation in a low dimensional space. Our analysis established that for more introverted individuals, regions of the ventral attention network were functionally more aligned to regions of the somatomotor system and the default mode network. At the same time, a pattern of detailed self-generated thought was associated with a decoupling of regions of dorsal attention from regions in the default mode network. Our study, therefore, establishes interactions between attention systems and the default mode network are important influences on ongoing thought at rest and highlights the value of integrating contemporary perspectives on conscious experience when understanding patterns of brain activity at rest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-range inhibitory neurons mediate cortical neurovascular coupling</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity evokes a vascular response that is essential to sustain brain function. We show that neurovascular coupling (NVC) is mediated by long-range projecting GABAergic neurons that express Tacr1. Whisker stimulation elicited Tacr1 neuron activity in the barrel cortex through feed-forward excitatory pathways. Optogenetic activation of Tacr1 neurons elicited vasodilation, whereas inhibition significantly reduced whisker-evoked hemodynamic responses. Moreover, vasodilation was preceded by capillary pericyte activity, demonstrating a mechanism for NVC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-state functional connectivity predictors of subjective visual Gestalt experience</a></h4>

              
                Subjective perceptual experience is influenced not only by bottom-up sensory information and experience-based top-down processes, but also by an individual's current brain state. Specifically, a previous study found increased prestimulus insula and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity before participants perceived an illusory Gestalt (global) compared to the non-illusory (local) interpretation in a bistable stimulus. This study provided only a snapshot of the prestimulus brain state that favors an illusory interpretation. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the neural machinery that biases perception towards the illusory interpretation immediately before the stimulus onset, is also predictive of an individual's general tendency to perceive it, which remains stable over time. We examined individual differences in task-free functional connectivity of insula and IPS and related it to differences in the individuals' duration of the two interpretations. We found stronger connectivity of the IPS with areas of the default mode and visual networks to predict shorter local perceptual phases, i.e., a faster switch to an illusory percept, but no equivalent results for the insula. Our findings suggest a crucial role of an IPS interaction with nodes of key intrinsic networks in forming a perceptual tendency towards illusory Gestalt perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Socially Integrated Polysubstance (SIP) system: an open-source solution for continuous monitoring of polysubstance fluid intake in group housed mice</a></h4>

              
                Despite impressive results from neuroscience research using rodent models, there is a paucity of successful translation from preclinical findings to effective pharmacological interventions for treatment of substance use disorder (SUD) in humans. One potential reason for lack of translation from animal models is difficulty in accurately replicating the lived experience of people who use drugs. Aspects of substance use in humans that are often not modeled in animal research include but are not limited to 1) voluntary timing and frequency of substance intake, 2) social environment during substance use, and 3) access to multiple substances and multiple concentrations of each substance. Critically, existing commercial equipment that allows for social housing and voluntary polysubstance use (e.g., home cage monitoring system) is prohibitively expensive and no open-source solutions exist. With these goals in mind, here we detail development of the Socially Integrated Polysubstance (SIP) system, an open-source and lower cost solution that allows for group housed rodents to self-administer multiple substances with continuous monitoring and measurement. In our current setup, each SIP cage contains four drinking stations, and each station is equipped with a RFID sensor and sipper tube connected to a unique fluid reservoir. Using this system, we can track which animal (implanted with unique RFID transponder) visits which drinking location and the amount they drink during each visit (in 20 ul increments). Using four flavors of Kool-Aid, here we demonstrate that the SIP system is reliable and accurate with high temporal resolution for long term monitoring of substance intake and behavior tracking in a social environment. The SIP cage system is a first step towards designing an accessible and flexible rodent model of substance use that more closely resembles the experience of people who use drugs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamocortical networks involved in Pusher Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Indirect quantification of functional and structural disconnection increases the knowledge derived from focal brain lesions by inferring subsequent brain network damage from the respective lesion. We applied both measures to a sample of 124 stroke patients to investigate brain disconnection in pusher syndrome - a disorder characterized by a disturbed perception of one's own upright body posture. Our results suggest a hub-like function of the posterior and lateral portions of the thalamus in the perception of ones own postural upright and identified dysfunction in a thalamo-cortical network as one likely cause of pusher syndrome. Lesion network-symptom-mapping investigating functional disconnection indicated cortical diaschisis in cerebellar, frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal areas in patients with thalamic lesions suffering from pusher syndrome, but there was no evidence for functional diaschisis in cortical stroke and no evidence for the convergence of thalamic and cortical lesions onto a common functional network. Structural disconnectivity mapping identified several thalamo-cortical disconnections. Many of the thalamic and cortical regions disconnected by lesions that lead to pusher behavior correspond to previously reported lesion sites associated with pusher syndrome. Thus, while the presence of both, isolated thalamic and cortical lesions in context with pusher behavior has been reported previously and led to the conclusion that the correct estimation of one's own postural upright might depend on a thalamo-cortical network, our analyses offer the first evidence for a direct thalamo-cortical (or cortico-thalamic) interconnection and, more importantly, shed light on the location of the respective thalamo-cortical disconnections.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Personalized Functional Brain Network Topography Predicts Individual Differences in Youth Cognition</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in cognition during childhood are associated with important social, physical, and mental health outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. Given that cortical surface arealization during development reflects the brain's functional prioritization, quantifying variation in the topography of functional brain networks across the developing cortex may provide insight regarding individual differences in cognition. We test this idea by defining personalized functional networks (PFNs) that account for interindividual heterogeneity in functional brain network topography in 9-10 year olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Across matched discovery (n=3,525) and replication (n=3,447) samples, the total cortical representation of fronto-parietal PFNs positively correlated with general cognition. Cross-validated ridge regressions trained on PFN topography predicted cognition across domains, with prediction accuracy increasing along the cortex's sensorimotor-association organizational axis. These results establish that functional network topography heterogeneity is associated with individual differences in cognition before the critical transition into adolescence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptojanin1 regulates lysosomal functions in ventral midbrain neurons</a></h4>

              
                A major pathological hallmark of Parkinsons Disease (PD) is the manifestation of Lewy bodies comprised of alpha-synuclein (a-syn). The accumulation of a-syn enriched protein aggregates is thought to arise from dysfunction in degradation systems within the brain. Recently, missense mutations of SYNJ1 encoding the SAC1 and 5-phosphatase domains have been found in families with hereditary early-onset Parkinsonism. Previous studies showed that Synj1 haploinsufficiency (Synj1+/-) leads to PD-like behavioral and pathological changes in mice, including the accumulation of the autophagy substrate p62 and pathological a-syn proteins in the midbrain (MB) and striatum. In this study, we aim to investigate the neuronal degradation pathway using the Synj1+/- MB culture as a model. Our data suggests that autophagy flux and cumulative autophagosome formation is unaltered at baseline in Synj1+/- MB neurons. However, lysosome number is reduced with a similar decrease in lysosomal proteins, including LAMP1, LAMP2, and LAMP2A. Lysosomes are hyperacidified with enhanced enzymatic activity in Synj1+/- MB neurons. Using a combination of light and electron microscopy, we show that lysosomal changes are primarily associated with a lack of SAC1 activity. Consistently, expressing the SYNJ1 R258Q mutant in N2a cells reduces the lysosome number. Interestingly, the lysosomal defects in Synj1+/- neurons does not impact the clearance of exogenously expressed wild-type a-syn; however, the clearance of a-syn A53T was impaired in the axons of Synj1+/- MB neurons. Taken together, our results suggest axonal vulnerability to lysosomal defects in Synj1 deficient MB neurons.

	<p>Healthy ageing is commonly accompanied by cognitive decline affecting several domains such as executive control, whereas certain verbal skills remain relatively preserved. Interestingly, recent scientific research has shown that some intellectual activities may be linked to beneficial effects, delaying or even alleviating cognitive decline in the elderly. Thirty young (age: M = 23) and thirty old (age: M = 66) adults were assessed in executive control (switching) and literacy experience (print exposure). First, we tried to confirm whether healthy ageing was generally associated with deficits in switching by looking at mixing cost effects, to then investigate if individual differences in print exposure explained variation in that age-related mixing costs. Both accuracy and reaction times mixing cost indexes demonstrated larger cost in old (but not in young) adults when switching from local to global information. More importantly, this cost effect was not present in old adults with higher print exposure (reaction times). Our findings suggest literacy experience accumulated across the life-span may act as a cognitive reserve proxy to prevent executive control decline.</p>

	<p>Recent reports suggest that results from imaging retinal microvascular changes with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in dementia patients reflect cerebral microcirculation changes that occur during dementia. Macula microvascular impairment has been shown in dementia patients compared to controls, but very little is known about its correlation with radiological visual rating scores associated with dementia. We aimed to explore the association between retinal microvasculature and radiological visual rating in early-onset dementia (EOD) patients. Methods: Swept-source OCTA (SS-OCTA) was used to image the retinal microvasculature of all EOD patients. Automated software in the OCTA tool segmented and measured the densities in the superficial vascular plexus (SVC) and deep vascular plexus (DVC) and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) areas. Radiological visual rating scores were evaluated on all MR images. Results: Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) scores significantly correlated with FAZ area (p = 0.031) in EOD patients after adjusting for risk factors. PWMH correlated with SVC (p = 0.032) while DWMH significantly correlated with SVC (p = 0.007), DVC (p = 0.018) and FAZ (p = 0.001) in EOD patients. Discussion: FAZ changes correlated with MTA scores in EOD patients, while retinal microvasculature correlated with white matter hyperintensity. Our report suggests that microvascular changes in the retina may reflect cortical changes in the brain of EOD patients.</p>

	<p>A possible link between chemotherapy and cognitive impairment has been identified. In the literature, this condition is usually called chemobrain and can mostly affect some memory domain but can lead also to other cognitive impairments. Olfaction, which is known to be linked with cognitive domain and the nociception system, can also be affected by chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the main cognitive and olfactory abilities and the functional and nutritional state of a cohort of chemotherapy and immunotherapy onco-geriatric patients and control geriatrics subjects. Cognitive, olfactory, geriatric and nutritional assessments were performed through the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks Screening 12, G8 test and a questionnaire on the adherence of the Mediterranean diet, respectively. Our findings show a gender effect on the MMSE. Overall results indicate more pronounced impairments both at the cognitive and frailty level regardless of the type of therapy. On the other hand, the Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks performances highlight a significant decrease in olfactory perception ability of subjects following immunotherapy. Significant correlations between olfactory performance and MMSE and G8 scores were also found, as well as between MMSE and G8 measures.</p>

	<p>Background: Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is an inherited autosomal dominant trait neuro-degenerative disorder caused by changes (mutations) of a gene called huntingtin (htt) that is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 4, CAG expansion mutation. It is characterized by unusual movements, cognitive and psychiatric disorders. Objective: This review was undertaken to apprehend biological pathways of Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD) pathogenesis and its management by nature-derived products. Natural products can be lucrative for the management of HD as it shows protection against HD in pre-clinical trials. Advanced research is still required to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of the known organic products and their isolated compounds in HD experimental models. Summary: Degeneration of neurons in Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is distinguished by progressive loss of motor coordination and muscle function. This is due to the expansion of CAG trinucleotide in the first exon of the htt gene responsible for neuronal death and neuronal network degeneration in the brain. It is believed that the factors such as molecular genetics, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroglia dysfunction, protein aggregation, and altered UPS leads to HD. The defensive effect of the natural product provides therapeutic efficacy against HD. Recent reports on natural drugs have enlightened the protective role against HD via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and neurofunctional regulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Spontaneous Cell Cluster Formation in Human iPSC-Derived Neuronal Spheroid Networks Influences Network Activity</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Three-dimensional neuronal culture systems such as spheroids, organoids, and assembloids constitute a branch of neuronal tissue engineering that has improved our ability to model the human brain in the laboratory. However, the more elaborate the brain model, the more difficult it becomes to study functional properties such as electrical activity at the neuronal level, similar to the challenges of studying neurophysiology <I>in vivo</I>. We describe a simple approach to generate self-assembled three-dimensional neuronal spheroid networks with defined human cell composition on microelectrode arrays. Such spheroid networks develop a highly three-dimensional morphology with cell clusters up to 60 &mu;m in thickness and are interconnected by pronounced bundles of neuronal fibers and glial processes. We could reliably record from up to hundreds of neurons simultaneously per culture for &le;90 d. By quantifying the formation of these three-dimensional structures over time, while regularly monitoring electrical activity, we were able to establish a strong link between spheroid morphology and network activity. In particular, the formation of cell clusters accelerates formation and maturation of correlated network activity. Astrocytes both influence electrophysiological network activity as well as accelerate the transition from single cell layers to cluster formation. Higher concentrations of astrocytes also have a strong effect of modulating synchronized network activity. This approach thus represents a practical alternative to often complex and heterogeneous organoids, providing easy access to activity within a brain-like 3D environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Oral Sensory Neurons of the Geniculate Ganglion That Express Tyrosine Hydroxylase Comprise a Subpopulation That Contacts Type II and Type III Taste Bud Cells</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Oral sensory neurons of the geniculate ganglion (GG) innervate taste papillae and buds on the tongue and soft palate. Electrophysiological recordings of these neurons and fibers revealed complexity in the number of unique response profiles observed, suggesting there are several distinct neuronal subtypes. Molecular descriptions of these subpopulations are incomplete. We report here the identification of a subpopulation of GG oral sensory neurons in mice by expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH-expressing geniculate neurons represent 10&ndash;20% of oral sensory neurons and these neurons innervate taste buds in fungiform and anterior foliate taste papillae on the surface of the tongue, as well as taste buds in the soft palate. While 35&ndash;50% of taste buds on the tongue are innervated by these TH+ neurons, 100% of soft palate taste buds are innervated. These neurons did not have extragemmal processes outside of taste buds and did not express the mechanosensory neuron-associated gene <I>Ret</I>, suggesting they are chemosensory and not somatosensory neurons. Within taste buds, TH-expressing fibers contacted both Type II and Type III cells, raising the possibility that they are responsive to more than one taste quality. During this analysis we also identified a rare TH+ taste receptor cell type that was found in only 12&ndash;25% of taste buds and co-expressed TRPM5, suggesting it was a Type II cell. Taken together, TH-expressing GG oral sensory neurons innervate taste buds preferentially in the soft palate and contact Type II and Type III taste bud receptor cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CNAViz: An interactive webtool for user-guided segmentation of tumor DNA sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zubair Lalani, Gillian Chu, Silas Hsu, Shaw Kagawa, Michael Xiang, Simone Zaccaria, Mohammed El-Kebir</p>

Copy-number aberrations (CNAs) are genetic alterations that amplify or delete the number of copies of large genomic segments. Although they are ubiquitous in cancer and, thus, a critical area of current cancer research, CNA identification from DNA sequencing data is challenging because it requires partitioning of the genome into complex segments with the same copy-number states that may not be contiguous. Existing segmentation algorithms address these challenges either by leveraging the local information among neighboring genomic regions, or by globally grouping genomic regions that are affected by similar CNAs across the entire genome. However, both approaches have limitations: overclustering in the case of local segmentation, or the omission of clusters corresponding to focal CNAs in the case of global segmentation. Importantly, inaccurate segmentation will lead to inaccurate identification of CNAs. For this reason, most pan-cancer research studies rely on manual procedures of quality control and anomaly correction. To improve copy-number segmentation, we introduce CNAViz, a web-based tool that enables the user to simultaneously perform local and global segmentation, thus overcoming the limitations of each approach. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that by several metrics, CNAViz allows the user to obtain more accurate segmentation relative to existing local and global segmentation methods. Moreover, we analyze six bulk DNA sequencing samples from three breast cancer patients. By validating with parallel single-cell DNA sequencing data from the same samples, we show that by using CNAViz, our user was able to obtain more accurate segmentation and improved accuracy in downstream copy-number calling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A machine learning model trained on a high-throughput antibacterial screen increases the hit rate of drug discovery</a></h4>

Screening for novel antibacterial compounds in small molecule libraries has a low success rate. We applied machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening for antibacterial activity and evaluated its predictive power by experimental validation. We first binarized 29,537 compounds according to their growth inhibitory activity (hit rate 0.87%) against the antibiotic-resistant bacterium <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> and described their molecular features with a directed-message passing neural network (D-MPNN). Then, we used the data to train an ML model that achieved a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) score of 0.823 on the test set. Finally, we predicted antibacterial activity in virtual libraries corresponding to 1,614 compounds from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved list and 224,205 natural products. Hit rates of 26% and 12%, respectively, were obtained when we tested the top-ranked predicted compounds for growth inhibitory activity against <i>B</i>. <i>cenocepacia</i>, which represents at least a 14-fold increase from the previous hit rate. In addition, more than 51% of the predicted antibacterial natural compounds inhibited ESKAPE pathogens showing that predictions expand beyond the organism-specific dataset to a broad range of bacteria. Overall, the developed ML approach can be used for compound prioritization before screening, increasing the typical hit rate of drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How do (perceptual) distracters distract?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tsvetomira Dumbalska, Katarzyna Rudzka, Hannah E. Smithson, Christopher Summerfield</p>

When a target stimulus occurs in the presence of distracters, decisions are less accurate. But how exactly do distracters affect choices? Here, we explored this question using measurement of human behaviour, psychophysical reverse correlation and computational modelling. We contrasted two models: one in which targets and distracters had independent influence on choices (independent model) and one in which distracters modulated choices in a way that depended on their similarity to the target (interaction model). Across three experiments, participants were asked to make fine orientation judgments about the tilt of a target grating presented adjacent to an irrelevant distracter. We found strong evidence for the interaction model, in that decisions were more sensitive when target and distracter were consistent relative to when they were inconsistent. This consistency bias occurred in the frame of reference of the decision, that is, it operated on decision values rather than on sensory signals, and surprisingly, it was independent of spatial attention. A normalization framework, where target features are normalized by the expectation and variability of the local context, successfully captures the observed pattern of results.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bounded rational decision-making models suggest capacity-limited concurrent motor planning in human posterior parietal and frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sonja Schach, Axel Lindner, Daniel Alexander Braun</p>

While traditional theories of sensorimotor processing have often assumed a serial decision-making pipeline, more recent approaches have suggested that multiple actions may be planned concurrently and vie for execution. Evidence for the latter almost exclusively stems from electrophysiological studies in posterior parietal and premotor cortex of monkeys. Here we study concurrent prospective motor planning in humans by recording functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a delayed response task engaging movement sequences towards multiple potential targets. We find that also in human posterior parietal and premotor cortex delay activity modulates both with sequence complexity and the number of potential targets. We tested the hypothesis that this modulation is best explained by concurrent prospective planning as opposed to the mere maintenance of potential targets in memory. We devise a bounded rationality model with information constraints that optimally assigns information resources for planning and memory for this task and determine predicted information profiles according to the two hypotheses. When regressing delay activity on these model predictions, we find that the concurrent prospective planning strategy provides a significantly better explanation of the fMRI-signal modulations. Moreover, we find that concurrent prospective planning is more costly and thus limited for most subjects, as expressed by the best fitting information capacities. We conclude that bounded rational decision-making models allow relating both behavior and neural representations to utilitarian task descriptions based on bounded optimal information-processing assumptions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Calibrating spatiotemporal models of microbial communities to microscopy data: A review</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aaron Yip, Julien Smith-Roberge, Sara Haghayegh Khorasani, Marc G. Aucoin, Brian P. Ingalls</p>

Spatiotemporal models that account for heterogeneity within microbial communities rely on single-cell data for calibration and validation. Such data, commonly collected via microscopy and flow cytometry, have been made more accessible by recent advances in microfluidics platforms and data processing pipelines. However, validating models against such data poses significant challenges. Validation practices vary widely between modelling studies; systematic and rigorous methods have not been widely adopted. Similar challenges are faced by the (macrobial) ecology community, in which systematic calibration approaches are often employed to improve quantitative predictions from computational models. Here, we review single-cell observation techniques that are being applied to study microbial communities and the calibration strategies that are being employed for accompanying spatiotemporal models. To facilitate future calibration efforts, we have compiled a list of summary statistics relevant for quantifying spatiotemporal patterns in microbial communities. Finally, we highlight some recently developed techniques that hold promise for improved model calibration, including algorithmic guidance of summary statistic selection and machine learning approaches for efficient model simulation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules on how to develop a stakeholder engagement plan</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Susanne Hollmann, Babette Regierer, Jaele Bechis, Lesley Tobin, Domenica D’Elia</p>

To make research responsible and research outcomes meaningful, it is necessary to communicate our research and to involve as many relevant stakeholders as possible, especially in application-oriented—including information and communications technology (ICT)—research. Nowadays, stakeholder engagement is of fundamental importance to project success and achieving the expected impact and is often mandatory in a third-party funding context. Ultimately, research and development can only be successful if people react positively to the results and benefits generated by a project. For the wider acceptance of research outcomes, it is therefore essential that the public is made aware of and has an opportunity to discuss the results of research undertaken through two-way communication (interpersonal communication) with researchers. Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations regarding research and innovation, aims to foster inclusive and sustainable research and innovation. Research and innovation processes need to become more responsive and adaptive to these grand challenges. This implies, among other things, the introduction of broader foresight and impact assessments for new technologies beyond their anticipated market benefits and risks. Therefore, this article provides a structured workflow that explains “<i>how to develop a stakeholder engagement plan</i>” step by step.

In 2020, the combination of police killings of unarmed Black people, including George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about public outrage over long-standing inequalities in society. The events of 2020 ignited global attention to systemic racism and racial inequalities, including the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the academy and especially in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields. Racial and ethnic diversity in graduate programs in particular warrants special attention as graduate students of color report experiencing alarming rates of racism, discrimination, microaggressions, and other exclusionary behaviors. As part of the Graduate Dean’s Advisory Council on Diversity (GDACD) at the University of California Merced, the authors of this manuscript held a year-long discussion on these issues and ways to take meaningful action to address these persistent issues of injustices. We have outlined 10 rules to help graduate programs develop antiracist practices to promote racial and ethnic justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) in the academy. We focus on efforts to address systemic causes of the underrepresentation and attrition of students from minoritized communities. The 10 rules are developed to allow graduate groups to formulate and implement rules and policies to address root causes of underrepresentation of minoritized students in graduate education.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatial clustering in vaccination hesitancy: The role of social influence and social selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lucila G. Alvarez-Zuzek, Casey M. Zipfel, Shweta Bansal</p>

The phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy behavior has gained ground over the last three decades, jeopardizing the maintenance of herd immunity. This behavior tends to cluster spatially, creating pockets of unprotected sub-populations that can be hotspots for outbreak emergence. What remains less understood are the social mechanisms that can give rise to spatial clustering in vaccination behavior, particularly at the landscape scale. We focus on the presence of spatial clustering, and aim to mechanistically understand how different social processes can give rise to this phenomenon. In particular, we propose two hypotheses to explain the presence of spatial clustering: (i) <i>social selection</i>, in which vaccine-hesitant individuals share socio-demographic traits, and clustering of these traits generates spatial clustering in vaccine hesitancy; and (ii) <i>social influence</i>, in which hesitant behavior is contagious and spreads through neighboring societies, leading to hesitant clusters. Adopting a theoretical spatial network approach, we explore the role of these two processes in generating patterns of spatial clustering in vaccination behaviors under a range of spatial structures. We find that both processes are independently capable of generating spatial clustering, and the more spatially structured the social dynamics in a society are, the higher spatial clustering in vaccine-hesitant behavior it realizes. Together, we demonstrate that these processes result in unique spatial configurations of hesitant clusters, and we validate our models of both processes with fine-grain empirical data on vaccine hesitancy, social determinants, and social connectivity in the US. Finally, we propose, and evaluate the effectiveness of two novel intervention strategies to diminish hesitant behavior. Our generative modeling approach informed by unique empirical data provides insights on the role of complex social processes in driving spatial heterogeneity in vaccine hesitancy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">OrthoSNAP: A tree splitting and pruning algorithm for retrieving single-copy orthologs from gene family trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jacob L. Steenwyk, Dayna C. Goltz, Thomas J. Buida III, Yuanning Li, Xing-Xing Shen, Antonis Rokas</p>

Molecular evolution studies, such as phylogenomic studies and genome-wide surveys of selection, often rely on gene families of single-copy orthologs (SC-OGs). Large gene families with multiple homologs in 1 or more species—a phenomenon observed among several important families of genes such as transporters and transcription factors—are often ignored because identifying and retrieving SC-OGs nested within them is challenging. To address this issue and increase the number of markers used in molecular evolution studies, we developed OrthoSNAP, a software that uses a phylogenetic framework to simultaneously split gene families into SC-OGs and prune species-specific inparalogs. We term SC-OGs identified by OrthoSNAP as SNAP-OGs because they are identified using a <i>s</i>plitti<i>n</i>g <i>a</i>nd <i>p</i>runing procedure analogous to snapping branches on a tree. From 415,129 orthologous groups of genes inferred across 7 eukaryotic phylogenomic datasets, we identified 9,821 SC-OGs; using OrthoSNAP on the remaining 405,308 orthologous groups of genes, we identified an additional 10,704 SNAP-OGs. Comparison of SNAP-OGs and SC-OGs revealed that their phylogenetic information content was similar, even in complex datasets that contain a whole-genome duplication, complex patterns of duplication and loss, transcriptome data where each gene typically has multiple transcripts, and contentious branches in the tree of life. OrthoSNAP is useful for increasing the number of markers used in molecular evolution data matrices, a critical step for robustly inferring and exploring the tree of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cryo-EM structures of LolCDE reveal the molecular mechanism of bacterial lipoprotein sorting in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Weiwei Bei, Qingshan Luo, Huigang Shi, Haizhen Zhou, Min Zhou, Xinzheng Zhang, Yihua Huang</p>

Bacterial lipoproteins perform a diverse array of functions including bacterial envelope biogenesis and microbe–host interactions. Lipoproteins in gram-negative bacteria are sorted to the outer membrane (OM) via the localization of lipoproteins (Lol) export pathway. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter LolCDE initiates the Lol pathway by selectively extracting and transporting lipoproteins for trafficking. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of LolCDE in apo, lipoprotein-bound, and AMPPNP-bound states at a resolution of 3.5 to 4.2 Å. Structure-based disulfide crosslinking, photo-crosslinking, and functional complementation assay verify the apo-state structure and reveal the molecular details regarding substrate selectivity and substrate entry route. Our studies snapshot 3 functional states of LolCDE in a transport cycle, providing deep insights into the mechanisms that underlie LolCDE-mediated lipoprotein sorting in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Conflict over fertilization underlies the transient evolution of reinforcement</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Catherine A. Rushworth, Alison M. Wardlaw, Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra, Yaniv Brandvain</p>

When two species meet in secondary contact, the production of low fitness hybrids may be prevented by the adaptive evolution of increased prezygotic isolation, a process known as reinforcement. Theoretical challenges to the evolution of reinforcement are generally cast as a coordination problem, i.e., “how can statistical associations between traits and preferences be maintained in the face of recombination?” However, the evolution of reinforcement also poses a potential conflict between mates. For example, the opportunity costs to hybridization may differ between the sexes or species. This is particularly likely for reinforcement based on postmating prezygotic (PMPZ) incompatibilities, as the ability to fertilize both conspecific and heterospecific eggs is beneficial to male gametes, but heterospecific mating may incur a cost for female gametes. We develop a population genetic model of interspecific conflict over reinforcement inspired by “gametophytic factors”, which act as PMPZ barriers among <i>Zea mays</i> subspecies. We demonstrate that this conflict results in the transient evolution of reinforcement—after females adaptively evolve to reject gametes lacking a signal common in conspecific gametes, this gamete signal adaptively introgresses into the other population. Ultimately, the male gamete signal fixes in both species, and isolation returns to pre-reinforcement levels. We interpret geographic patterns of isolation among <i>Z</i>. <i>mays</i> subspecies considering these findings and suggest when and how this conflict can be resolved. Our results suggest that sexual conflict over fertilization may pose an understudied obstacle to the evolution of reinforcement.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">LRRC15 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry in trans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jaewon Song, Ryan D. Chow, Mario Pena-Hernandez, Li Zhang, Skylar A. Loeb, Eui-Young So, Olin D. Liang, Ping Ren, Sidi Chen, Craig B. Wilen, Sanghyun Lee</p>

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is mediated by the entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Although attachment factors and coreceptors facilitating entry are extensively studied, cellular entry factors inhibiting viral entry are largely unknown. Using a <i>surface</i>ome CRISPR activation screen, we identified human LRRC15 as an inhibitory attachment factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. LRRC15 directly binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with a moderate affinity and inhibits spike-mediated entry. Analysis of human lung single-cell RNA sequencing dataset reveals that expression of LRRC15 is primarily detected in fibroblasts and particularly enriched in pathological fibroblasts in COVID-19 patients. <i>ACE2</i> and <i>LRRC15</i> are not coexpressed in the same cell types in the lung. Strikingly, expression of LRRC15 in ACE2-negative cells blocks spike-mediated viral entry in ACE2+ cell <i>in trans</i>, suggesting a protective role of LRRC15 in a physiological context. Therefore, LRRC15 represents an inhibitory attachment factor for SARS-CoV-2 that regulates viral entry <i>in trans</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Circadian regulation of the transcriptome in a complex polyploid crop</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hannah Rees, Rachel Rusholme-Pilcher, Paul Bailey, Joshua Colmer, Benjamen White, Connor Reynolds, Sabrina Jaye Ward, Benedict Coombes, Calum A. Graham, Luíza Lane de Barros Dantas, Antony N. Dodd, Anthony Hall</p>

The circadian clock is a finely balanced timekeeping mechanism that coordinates programmes of gene expression. It is currently unknown how the clock regulates expression of homoeologous genes in polyploids. Here, we generate a high-resolution time-course dataset to investigate the circadian balance between sets of 3 homoeologous genes (triads) from hexaploid bread wheat. We find a large proportion of circadian triads exhibit imbalanced rhythmic expression patterns, with no specific subgenome favoured. In wheat, period lengths of rhythmic transcripts are found to be longer and have a higher level of variance than in other plant species. Expression of transcripts associated with circadian controlled biological processes is largely conserved between wheat and <i>Arabidopsis</i>; however, striking differences are seen in agriculturally critical processes such as starch metabolism. Together, this work highlights the ongoing selection for balance versus diversification in circadian homoeologs and identifies clock-controlled pathways that might provide important targets for future wheat breeding.

                On 30 May, the Chilean Climate Change Framework Law was enacted to address climate change challenges and decrease Chile’s greenhouse gases with a goal of emissions neutrality by 2050 (1). The framework includes climate change mitigation through nature-based solutions such as carbon sinks (i.e., trees and soils that absorb more carbon than they release) in native forests and plantations with native species, but it discourages monoculture plantations. The strategies in the law underestimate the potential environmental value of monocultures.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cannabis use among pregnant people has increased over the past decade. This is of concern as prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) is associated with cognitive, motor, and social deficits among offspring. Here, we examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the salience network (SN)—a core neurocognitive network that integrates emotional and sensory information—in children with (vs. without) PCE. Using neuroimaging and developmental history data collected from 10,719 children (M ± SD = 9.92 ± 0.62 years; 47.9% female) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, we assessed the impact of parent-reported PCE (before or after knowledge of pregnancy) on rsFC within and between the SN and five other core neurocognitive networks. We also evaluated whether SN rsFC mediated the association between PCE and child psychopathology. Results showed that PCE before (but not after) knowledge of pregnancy was associated with lower SN-ventral attention network (VAN) rsFC. Furthermore, psychotic-like experiences mediated the association between PCE and SN-VAN rsFC, and reversal of the model was also significant, such that SN-VAN rsFC mediated the association between PCE and psychotic-like symptoms. However, these mediation effects were no longer significant after the inclusion of covariates. Taken together, these findings suggest that developmental alterations in SN-VAN interactions may explain the previously reported association between PCE and elevated risk of child psychopathology.</p>

                We report a rare case of a vertebro-vertebral arteriovenous fistula (VVAVF) manifesting as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 76-year-old female patient presented with progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, fasciculation, and preserved deep tendon reflexes in the right upper limb. Electrophysiological testing showed lower motor neuron dysfunction. The patient was suspected to have ALS, but cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed enlarged blood vessels in the spinal canal, which compressed the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots. Angiography showed a shunt from the right vertebral artery to the right intervertebral vein and the vertebral venous plexus; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with VVAVF. Transarterial embolization was performed to obliterate the shunt, and weakness in the patient’s right upper limb subsequently improved. It is worth considering VVAVF as a differential diagnosis of ALS-like diseases.

                Background.  Various in vitro studies have shown fluoxetine inhibits multiple variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic and multiple observational clinical studies have shown that patients receiving fluoxetine experienced clinical benefit by lowering the risk of intubation and death. The aim of this study is to conduct population pharmacokinetic dosing simulations to quantify the percentage of patients achieving a trough level for the effective concentration resulting in 50% (EC50) and 90% (EC90) inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 as reported in Calu-3 human lung cells. Methods.  Pharmacometric parameter estimates used in this study were obtained from the U.S. FDA website from a new drug application for fluoxetine hydrochloride. A population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine antidepressant doses (20 mg/day, 30 mg/day, 40 mg/day, 50 mg/day, and 60 mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough plasma level for the EC50 and EC90 SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. All analyses were conducted in R. Results.  By day-10 at 20 mg/day, 93.2% and 47% of the population will achieve the trough target plasma EC50 and EC90 concentrations, respectively, which translates to a lung tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher EC50 (283.6 ng/ml [0.82 mM]) and EC90 (1390.1 ng/ml [4.02 mM]). Further, by day-10 at an ideal dose of 40 mg/day, 99% and 93% of patients will reach the trough EC50 and EC90 concentrations, respectfully. Lastly, only a dose of 60 mg/day will reach the SARS-CoV-2 EC90 inhibitory concentration in the brain at pharmacokinetic steady-state. Conclusion. Overall, with a minimum treatment period of 10-days and a minimum dose of 20 mg/day, this study corroborates in vitro studies reporting fluoxetine inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 titers and also multiple observational clinical studies showing therapeutic benefit of fluoxetine in COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Scavenger: A pipeline for recovery of unaligned reads utilising similarity with aligned reads [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Read alignment is an important step in RNA-seq analysis as the result of alignment forms the basis for downstream analyses. However, recent studies have shown that published alignment tools have variable mapping sensitivity and do not necessarily align all the reads which should have been aligned, a problem we termed as the false-negative non-alignment problem. Here we present Scavenger, a python-based bioinformatics pipeline for recovering unaligned reads using a novel mechanism in which a putative alignment location is discovered based on sequence similarity between aligned and unaligned reads. We showed that Scavenger could recover unaligned reads in a range of simulated and real RNA-seq datasets, including single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that recovered reads tend to contain more genetic variants with respect to the reference genome compared to previously aligned reads, indicating that divergence between personal and reference genomes plays a role in the false-negative non-alignment problem. Even when the number of recovered reads is relatively small compared to the total number of reads, the addition of these recovered reads can impact downstream analyses, especially in terms of estimating the expression and differential expression of lowly expressed genes, such as pseudogenes.

                Miller et al. densely sampled brain activity with human neuroimaging during working memory across months of learning. Long-term training altered the role of the prefrontal cortex, which developed representations for specific stimuli and associations learned over time. Working memory is shaped by long-term experience, which may help resolve competing accounts of prefrontal functioning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vocalization categorization behavior explained by a feature-based auditory categorization model</a></h4>

              
                Vocal animals produce multiple categories of calls with high between- and within-subject variability, over which listeners must generalize to accomplish call categorization. The behavioral strategies and neural mechanisms that support this ability to generalize are largely unexplored. We previously proposed a theoretical model that accomplished call categorization by detecting features of intermediate complexity that best contrasted each call category from all other categories. We further demonstrated that some neural responses in the primary auditory cortex were consistent with such a model. Here, we asked whether a feature-based model could predict call categorization behavior. We trained both the model and guinea pigs on call categorization tasks using natural calls. We then tested categorization by the model and guinea pigs using temporally and spectrally altered calls. Both the model and guinea pigs were surprisingly resilient to temporal manipulations, but sensitive to moderate frequency shifts. Critically, the model predicted about 50% of the variance in guinea pig behavior. By adopting different model training strategies and examining features that contributed to solving specific tasks, we could gain insight into possible strategies used by animals to categorize calls. Our results validate a model that uses the detection of intermediate-complexity contrastive features to accomplish call categorization.

                Revealing the functioning of compound eyes is of interest to biologists and engineers alike who wish to understand how visually complex behaviours (e.g. detection, tracking, navigation) arise in nature, and to abstract concepts to develop novel artificial sensory systems. A key investigative method is to replicate the sensory apparatus using artificial systems, allowing for investigation of the visual information that drives animal behaviour when exposed to environmental cues. To date, 'Compound Eye Models' (CEMs) have largely explored features such field of view and angular resolution, but the role of shape and overall structure have been largely overlooked due to modelling complexity. Modern real-time raytracing technologies are enabling the construction of a new generation of computationally fast, high-fidelity CEMs. This work introduces a new open-source CEM software (CompoundRay) that is capable of accurately rendering the visual perspective of bees (6,000 individual ommatidia arranged on two realistic eye surfaces) at over 3,000 frames per second. We show how the speed and accuracy facilitated by this software can be used to investigate pressing research questions (e.g. how low resolutions compound eyes can localise small objects) using modern methods (e.g. ML information exploration).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The wtf meiotic driver gene family has unexpectedly persisted for over 100 million years</a></h4>

              
                Meiotic drivers are selfish elements that bias their own transmission into more than half of the viable progeny produced by a driver+/driver− heterozygote. Meiotic drivers are thought to exist for relatively short evolutionary timespans because a driver gene or gene family is often found in a single species or in a group of very closely related species. Additionally, drivers are generally considered doomed to extinction when they spread to fixation or when suppressors arise. In this study, we examine the evolutionary history of the <i>wtf</i> meiotic drivers first discovered in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>. We identify homologous genes in three other fission yeast species, <i>S. octosporus</i>, <i>S. osmophilus</i>, and <i>S. cryophilus</i>, which are estimated to have diverged over 100 million years ago from the <i>S. pombe</i> lineage. Synteny evidence supports that <i>wtf</i> genes were present in the common ancestor of these four species. Moreover, the ancestral genes were likely drivers as <i>wtf</i> genes in <i>S. octosporus</i> cause meiotic drive. Our findings indicate that meiotic drive systems can be maintained for long evolutionary timespans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Antibacterial T6SS effectors with a VRR-Nuc domain are structure-specific nucleases</a></h4>

              
                The type VI secretion system (T6SS) secretes antibacterial effectors into target competitors. <i>Salmonella</i> spp. encode five phylogenetically distinct T6SSs. Here we characterize the function of the SPI-22 T6SS of <i>Salmonella bongori</i> showing that it has antibacterial activity and identify a group of antibacterial T6SS effectors (TseV1-4) containing an N-terminal PAAR-like domain and a C-terminal VRR-Nuc domain encoded next to cognate immunity proteins with a DUF3396 domain (TsiV1-4). TseV2 and TseV3 are toxic when expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and bacterial competition assays confirm that TseV2 and TseV3 are secreted by the SPI-22 T6SS. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that TseV1-4 are evolutionarily related to enzymes involved in DNA repair. TseV3 recognizes specific DNA structures and preferentially cleave splayed arms, generating DNA double-strand breaks and inducing the SOS response in target cells. The crystal structure of the TseV3:TsiV3 complex reveals that the immunity protein likely blocks the effector interaction with the DNA substrate. These results expand our knowledge on the function of <i>Salmonella</i> pathogenicity islands, the evolution of toxins used in biological conflicts, and the endogenous mechanisms regulating the activity of these toxins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Postsynaptic burst reactivation of hippocampal neurons enables associative plasticity of temporally discontiguous inputs</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental unresolved problem in neuroscience is how the brain associates in memory events that are separated in time. Here we propose that reactivation-induced synaptic plasticity can solve this problem. Previously, we reported that the reinforcement signal dopamine converts hippocampal spike timing-dependent depression into potentiation during continued synaptic activity (Brzosko et al., 2015). Here, we report that postsynaptic bursts in the presence of dopamine produce input-specific LTP in mouse hippocampal synapses 10 minutes after they were primed with coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity (post-before-pre pairing; Δt = -20 ms). This priming activity induces synaptic depression and sets an NMDA receptor-dependent silent eligibility trace which, through the cAMP-PKA cascade, is rapidly converted into protein synthesis-dependent synaptic potentiation, mediated by a signaling pathway distinct from that of conventional LTP. This synaptic learning rule was incorporated into a computational model, and we found that it adds specificity to reinforcement learning by controlling memory allocation and enabling both ‘instructive’ and 'supervised' reinforcement learning. We predicted that this mechanism would make reactivated neurons activate more strongly and carry more spatial information than non-reactivated cells, which was confirmed in freely moving mice performing a reward-based navigation task.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early life stressful experiences escalate aggressive behavior in adulthood via changes in transthyretin expression and function</a></h4>

              
                Escalated and inappropriate levels of aggressive behavior referred to as pathological in psychiatry can lead to violent outcomes with detrimental impact on health and society. Early life stressful experiences might increase the risk of developing pathological aggressive behavior in adulthood, though molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we provide prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus specific transcriptome profiles of peripubertal stress (PPS) exposed Balb/c adult male mice exhibiting escalated aggression and adult female mice resilient to such aberrant behavioral responses. We identify transthyretin (TTR), a well known thyroid hormone transporter, as a key regulator of PPS induced escalated aggressive behavior in males. Brain region specific long-term changes in <i>Ttr</i> gene expression and thyroid hormone (TH) availability were evident in PPS induced escalated aggressive male mice, circulating TH being unaltered. <i>Ttr</i> promoter methylation marks were also altered being hypermethylated in hypothalamus and hypomethylated in prefrontal cortex corroborating with its expression pattern. Further, <i>Ttr</i> knockdown in hypothalamus resulted in escalated aggressive behavior in males without PPS and also reduced TH levels and expression of TH responsive genes (<i>Nrgn</i>, <i>Trh</i> and <i>Hr</i>). Escalated aggressive behavior along with reduced <i>Ttr</i> gene expression and TH levels in hypothalamus was also evident in next generation F1 male progenies. Our findings reveal that stressful experiences during puberty might trigger lasting escalated aggression by modulating TTR expression in brain. TTR can serve as a potential target in reversal of escalated aggression and related psychopathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep mutational scanning and machine learning reveal structural and molecular rules governing allosteric hotspots in homologous proteins</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental question in protein science is where allosteric hotspots - residues critical for allosteric signaling - are located, and what properties differentiate them. We carried out deep mutational scanning (DMS) of four homologous bacterial allosteric transcription factors (aTF) to identify hotspots and built a machine learning model with this data to glean the structural and molecular properties of allosteric hotspots. We found hotspots to be distributed protein-wide rather than being restricted to 'pathways' linking allosteric and active sites as is commonly assumed. Despite structural homology, the location of hotspots was not superimposable across the aTFs. However, common signatures emerged when comparing hotspots coincident with long-range interactions, suggesting that the allosteric mechanism is conserved among the homologs despite differences in molecular details. Machine learning with our large DMS datasets revealed that global structural and dynamic properties to be a strong predictor of whether a residue is a hotspot than local and physicochemical properties. Furthermore, a model trained on one protein can predict hotspots in a homolog. In summary, the overall allosteric mechanism is embedded in the structural fold of the aTF family, but the finer, molecular details are sequence-specific.

                Hydrogen peroxide is the most common reactive chemical that organisms face on the microbial battlefield. The rate with which hydrogen peroxide damages biomolecules required for life increases with temperature, yet little is known about how organisms cope with this temperature-dependent threat. Here, we show that <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematodes use temperature information perceived by sensory neurons to cope with the temperature-dependent threat of hydrogen peroxide produced by the pathogenic bacterium <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>. These nematodes preemptively induce the expression of specific hydrogen peroxide defenses in response to perception of high temperature by a pair of sensory neurons. These neurons communicate temperature information to target tissues expressing those defenses via an insulin/IGF1 hormone. This is the first example of a multicellular organism inducing their defenses to a chemical when they sense an inherent enhancer of the reactivity of that chemical.

                Several lines of evidence indicate verbal abuse (VA) critically impacts the developing brain; however, whether VA results in changes in brain neurochemistry has not been established in humans. Here, we hypothesized that exposure to recurrent parental VA elicits heightened glutamate (Glu) responses during the presentation of swear words, which can be measured with functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS). During an emotional Stroop task consisting of blocks of color and swear words, metabolite concentration changes were measured in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the left amygdalohippocampal region (AMHC) of healthy adults (14 F/27 M, 234 years old) using fMRS. The dynamic changes in Glu and their associations with the emotional state of the participants were finally evaluated based on 36 datasets from the vmPFC and 30 from the AMHC. A repeated-measures analysis of covariance revealed a modest effect of parental VA severity on Glu changes in the vmPFC. Furthermore, the total score on the Verbal Abuse Questionnaire by parents (pVAQ) was associated with the Glu response to swear words (GluSwe). The interaction term of GluSwe and baseline N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) level in the vmPFC could be used to predict state-trait anxiety level and depressive mood. We could not find any significant associations between GluSwe in the AMHC and either pVAQ or emotional states. Several lines of evidence indicate verbal abuse (VA) critically impacts the developing brain; however, whether VA results in changes in brain neurochemistry has not been established in humans. Here, we hypothesized that exposure to recurrent parental VA elicits heightened glutamate (Glu) responses during the presentation of swear words, which can be measured with functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS). During an emotional Stroop task consisting of blocks of color and swear words, metabolite concentration changes were measured in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the left amygdalohippocampal region (AMHC) of healthy adults (14 F/27 M, 234 years old) using fMRS. The dynamic changes in Glu and their associations with the emotional state of the participants were finally evaluated based on 36 datasets from the vmPFC and 30 from the AMHC. A repeated-measures analysis of covariance revealed a modest effect of parental VA severity on Glu changes in the vmPFC. Furthermore, the total score on the Verbal Abuse Questionnaire by parents (pVAQ) was associated with the Glu response to swear words (GluSwe). The interaction term of GluSwe and baseline N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) level in the vmPFC could be used to predict state-trait anxiety level and depressive mood. We could not find any significant associations between GluSwe in the AMHC and either pVAQ or emotional states. We conclude that parental VA exposure in individuals is associated with a greater Glu response towards VA-related stimuli in the vmPFC and that the accompanying low NAA level may be associated with anxiety level or depressive mood.We conclude that parental VA exposure in individuals is associated with a greater Glu response towards VA-related stimuli in the vmPFC and that the accompanying low NAA level may be associated with anxiety level or depressive mood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seg2Link: an efficient and versatile solution for semi-automatic cell segmentation in 3D image stacks</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in microscopy techniques, especially in electron microscopy, are transforming biomedical studies by acquiring large quantities of high-precision 3D cell image stacks. However, to study cell morphology and connectivity in organs such as brains, scientists must first perform cell segmentation, which involves extracting individual cell regions of various shapes and sizes from a 3D image. This remains a great challenge because automatic cell segmentation can contain numerous errors, even with advanced deep learning methods. For biomedical research that requires cell segmentation in large 3D image stacks, an efficient semi-automated software solution is still needed. We created Seg2Link, which generates automatic segmentations based on deep learning predictions and allows users to quickly correct errors in the segmentation results. It can perform automatic instance segmentation of 2D cells in each slice, 3D cell linking across slices, and various manual corrections, in order to efficiently transform inaccurate deep learning predictions into accurate segmentation results. Seg2Link's data structure and algorithms were also optimized to process 3D images with billions of voxels on a personal computer quickly. Thus, Seg2Link offers a simple and effective way for scientists to study cell morphology and connectivity in 3D image stacks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological population dynamics reveal context dependencies during decision making in human frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                During economic choice, evidence from monkeys and humans suggest that activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encodes the subjective values of options under consideration. Monkey data further suggests that value representations in the OFC are context dependent, representing subjective value in a way influenced by the decision makers recent experience. Using stereo electroencephalography (sEEG) in human subjects, we investigated the neural representations of both past and present subjective values in the OFC, insula, cingulate and parietal cortices, amygdala, hippocampus and striatum. Patients with epilepsy (n=20) reported their willingness to pay--a measure of subjective value--for snack food items in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschack (BDM) auction task. We found that the high frequency power (gamma and high-gamma bands) in the OFC positively correlated with the current subjective value but negatively correlated with the subjective value of the good offered on the last trial - a kind of temporal context dependency not yet observed in humans. These representations were observed at both the group level (across electrode contacts and subjects) and at the level of individual contacts. Noticeably, the majority of significant contacts represented either the present or past subjective value, but not both. A dynamic dimensionality-reduction analysis of OFC population trajectories suggested that the past trial begin to influence activity early in the current trial after the current offer was revealed, and that these two properties--current and past subjective values--dominate the electrophysiological signals. Together, these findings indicate that information about the value of the past and present rewards are simultaneously represented in the human OFC, and offer insights into the algorithmic structure of context-dependent computation during human economic choice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell analysis characterizes non-enhancing region of recurrent high-grade glioma</a></h4>

              
                Both therapy for and molecular investigations into high-grade glioma largely focus on the contrast-enhancing (CE) portion of the tumor. However, given the invasive nature of glioma, residual tumor cells responsible for recurrence exist in the peripheral, non-enhancing (NE) region. Single-cell/single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analyses offer a flexible and scalable framework that allows powerful examination of tumor and non-tumor cell subpopulations across various contexts. In this study, we used pre-operative magnetic resonance images to prospectively identify biopsy targets in the CE region and NE sites that lie 0.5-2.0 cm beyond the CE edge from multiple pathologically and molecularly distinct recurrent high-grade gliomas and leveraged single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to generate over 30,000 individual RNA profiles. We analyzed multiple glioma cellular states, non-malignant cell types, and cell-cell interaction patterns, all of which revealed both conserved and patient-specific features. Recurrent gliomas recapitulate the previously reported cellular heterogeneity of primary gliomas. Systematic comparison of the CE and NE regions identified altered composition of malignant and non-malignant cell compartments, as well as cell type- and patient-specific differences in gene expression and pathway activation profiles. We established that NE regions up to 1.5 cm beyond the CE edge contain up to 60% infiltrating malignant cells, of which a significant subset are actively proliferating. These NE glioma cells are preferentially in OPC-like and NPC-like rather than MES-like cellular states. NE cells have altered gene expression patterns, with specific upregulation of certain genes like DGKB and OPHN1 relative to CE regions. We built an integrated atlas of cell-cell communication networks among malignant and non-malignant subpopulations in the two regions of glioma and identified a significantly rewired connectome in the NE regions of all tumors. With respect to tumor-immune interactions, NE regions had decreased numbers of T cells and myeloid cells, along with decreased HLA:CD8 signaling between glioma and immune cells, suggesting decreased immune detection and cell mediated immunity. Furthermore, our findings suggest glioma cells in NE regions maintain interactions with non-malignant neural tissue. Overall, we characterize the NE region in all pathological subtypes of recurrent high-grade glioma and identify possible mechanisms driving progression and recurrence, as well as areas of future therapeutic study.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physics-based Deep Learning for Imaging Neuronal Activity via Two-photon and Light Field Microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Light Field Microscopy (LFM) is an imaging technique that offers the opportunity to study fast dynamics in biological systems due to its rapid 3D imaging rate. In particular, it is attractive to analyze neuronal activity in the brain. Unlike scanning-based imaging methods, LFM simultaneously encodes the spatial and angular information of light in a single snapshot. However, LFM is limited by a trade-off between spatial and angular resolution and is affected by scattering at deep layers in the brain tissue. In contrast, two-photon (2P) microscopy is a point-scanning 3D imaging technique that achieves higher spatial resolution, deeper tissue penetration, and reduced scattering effects. However, point-scanning acquisition limits the imaging speed in 2P microscopy and cannot be used to simultaneously monitor the activity of a large population of neurons. This work introduces a physics-driven deep neural network to image neuronal activity in scattering volume tissues using LFM. The architecture of the network is obtained by unfolding the ISTA algorithm and is based on the observation that the neurons in the tissue are sparse. The deep-network architecture is also based on a novel imaging system modeling that uses a linear convolutional neural network and fits the physics of the acquisition process. To achieve the high-quality reconstruction of neuronal activity in 3D brain tissues from temporal sequences of light field (LF) images, we train the network in a semi-supervised manner using generative adversarial networks (GANs). We use the TdTomato indicator to obtain static structural information of the tissue with the microscope operating in 2P scanning modality, representing the target reconstruction quality. We also use additional functional data in LF modality with GCaMP indicators to train the network. Our approach is tested under adverse conditions: limited training data, background noise, and scattering samples. We experimentally show that our method performs better than model-based reconstruction strategies and typical artificial neural networks for imaging neuronal activity in mammalian brain tissue, considering reconstruction quality, generalization to functional imaging, and reconstruction speed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A meta-analysis of the effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on rodent fear conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been increasingly recognized for their potential value in pre-clinical research, but their multiple applications have not been extensively explored in behavioral neuroscience. In this work, we studied protein synthesis inhibition, a classic intervention used to disrupt fear learning, reconsolidation, and extinction in rodents, to explore how meta-analyses can identify potential moderators of its effect. We initially performed separate meta-analyses for different injection sites (systemic, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebral ventricles) and target sessions (training, reconsolidation and extinction) to evaluate the effect of the intervention in various scenarios. Heterogeneity was further investigated by uni- and multivariable meta-regression using models aggregating various sites, with article or research group as additional levels. We detected robust effects of protein synthesis inhibitors on training and reconsolidation, but not on extinction, possibly due to the lower number of studies on the latter. Our analyses identified some well-established moderators, such as injection timing for training interventions and reexposure duration for reactivation interventions. However, other factors proposed as boundary conditions for reconsolidation, such as training strength and memory age, were not associated with effect size across the literature. Additionally, our findings suggest some underexplored associations, such as a larger susceptibility of cued fear conditioning to reconsolidation when compared to the contextual version of the task. While our results point to the value of meta-analyses in consolidating findings from the literature, we believe that associations suggested by data synthesis should ideally be verified by well-powered, rigorous confirmatory experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The function of ethanol in olfactory associative behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster larvae</a></h4>

              
                Drosophila melanogaster larvae develop on fermenting fruits with increasing ethanol concentrations. To address the relevance of ethanol in the behavioral response of the larvae, we analyzed the function of ethanol in the context of olfactory associative behavior in Canton S and w1118 larvae. The motivation of larvae to move toward or out of an ethanol-containing substrate depends on the ethanol concentration and the genotype. Ethanol in the substrate reduces the attraction to odorant cues in the environment. Relatively short repetitive exposures to ethanol, which are comparable in their duration to reinforcer representation in olfactory associative learning and memory paradigms, result in positive or negative association with the paired odorant or indifference to it. The outcome depends on the order in which the reinforcer is presented during training, the genotype and the presence of the reinforcer during the test. Independent of the order of odorant presentation during training, Canton S and w1118 larvae do not form a positive or negative association with the odorant when ethanol is not present in the test context. When ethanol is present in the test, w1118 larvae show aversion to an odorant paired with a naturally occurring ethanol concentration of 5%. Our results provide insights into the parameters influencing olfactory associative behaviors using ethanol as a reinforcer in Drosophila larvae and indicate that short exposures to ethanol might not uncover the positive rewarding properties of ethanol for developing larvae.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Polyphasic circadian neural circuits drive differential activities in multiple downstream rhythmic centers</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks align various behaviors such as locomotor activity, sleep/wake, feeding, and mating to times of day that are most adaptive. How rhythmic information in pacemaker circuits is translated to neuronal outputs is not well understood. Here we used brain-wide, 24-hr in vivo calcium imaging in the Drosophila brain and searched for circadian rhythmic activity among identified clusters of dopaminergic (DA) and peptidergic neuroendocrine (PNE) neurons. Such rhythms were widespread and imposed by the PERIOD-dependent clock activity within the [~]150 cell circadian pacemaker network. The rhythms displayed either a Morning, an Evening, or Mid-Day phase. Different sub-groups of circadian pacemakers imposed neural activity rhythms onto different downstream non-clock neurons. Outputs from the canonical M and E pacemakers converged to regulate DA-PPM3 and DA-PAL neurons. E pacemakers regulate the Evening-active DA-PPL1 neurons. In addition to these canonical M and E oscillators, we present evidence for a third dedicated phase occurring at Mid-Day (MD): the l-LNv pacemakers present the MD activity peak and they regulate the MD-active DA-PPM1/2 neurons and three distinct PNE cell types. Thus, the Drosophila circadian pacemaker network is a polyphasic rhythm generator. It presents dedicated M, E and MD phases that are functionally transduced as neuronal outputs to organize diverse daily activity patterns in downstream circuits.

                Ventral subiculum (vSUB) is the major output region of ventral hippocampus (vHIPP) and sends major projections to nucleus accumbens medial shell (NAcMS). Hyperactivity of the vSUB-NAcMS circuit is associated with substance use disorders (SUDs) and the modulation of vSUB activity alters drug seeking and drug reinstatement behavior in rodents. However, to the best of our knowledge, the cell-type specific connectivity and synaptic transmission properties of the vSUB-NAcMS circuit have never been directly examined. Instead, previous functional studies have focused on total ventral hippocampal (vHIPP) output to NAcMS without distinguishing vSUB from other subregions of vHIPP, including ventral CA1 (vCA1). Using ex vivo electrophysiology, we systematically characterized the vSUB-NAcMS circuit with cell-type and synapse specific resolution in male and female mice and found that vSUB output to dopamine receptor type-1 (D1R) and type-2 (D2R) expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) displays a functional connectivity bias for D2R MSNs. Furthermore, we found that vSUB-D1R and -D2R MSN synapses contain calcium-permeable AMPA receptors in drug-naive mice. Finally, we find that, distinct from other glutamatergic inputs, cocaine exposure selectively induces plasticity at vSUB-D2R synapses. Importantly, we directly compared vSUB and vCA1 output to NAcMS and found that vSUB synapses are functionally distinct and that vCA1 output recapitulated the synaptic properties previously ascribed to vHIPP. Our work highlights the need to consider the contributions of individual subregions of vHIPP to SUDs and represents an important first step toward understanding how the vSUB-NAcMS circuit contributes to the etiologies that underlie SUDs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Post-saccadic following in the marmoset monkey as a read-out of pre-saccadic attention</a></h4>

              
                During natural visual foraging, primates move their eyes 2-3 times per second to bring objects of interest to central, high-resolution vision at the fovea. For moving objects, they use a combination of rapid saccadic eye movements along with smooth following movements to track targets continuously. It is also known that saccadic eye movements produce perceptual enhancements for the saccade target before the eyes move, called pre-saccadic attention. Recently, in human participants, we found that saccades made to peripheral motion apertures resulted in smooth post-saccadic following that tracked stimulus motion at low gain (Kwon, Rolfs, & Mitchell, 2019). Because this effect persisted even when the stimulus disappeared in saccade flight, we can infer the post-saccadic following was predictive, reflecting the integration of peripheral motion information from the target before the saccade, and provides an automatic perceptual read-out of stimulus motion. Here we examined post-saccadic following in marmoset monkeys to determine if they automatically tracked stimulus motion like humans, and if so, if that following response could be used as a reliable behavioral read-out of motion. Marmosets performed a saccade foraging task in which they initially acquired central fixation and then made a saccade that sampled between three different motion apertures. For each trial, the direction of motion of each aperture was independently sampled from 16 directions. We found that immediately upon saccade offset, the marmosets eye traces followed the pre-saccadic motion with a low (10-20%) gain that was consistent with humans. We also found that the motion from other non-target apertures influenced following responses though with a much weaker gain. The gain was distributed equally across apertures before the saccade, but immediately after the saccade was enhanced for the saccade target relative to other apertures, consistent with a post-saccadic target enhancement found in smooth pursuit (Gardener and Lisberger, 2001). This following response provided an estimate of target motion with a median absolute angular errors ranging from 25 to 50 degrees across sessions, roughly half as accurate as that achieved with an explicit trained perceptual report (Cloherty et. al., 2020). Session by session the relative gain for the target as compared to other apertures also varied, providing an index of attentional selection. These findings support that natural visual foraging with moving targets can provide an automatic behavioral read-out of peripheral motion integration and pre-saccadic attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">OPTIMIZED NEURON TRACING USING POST HOC REANALYSIS</a></h4>

              
                Over the last decade, the advances in Brainbow labeling allowed labeling hundreds of neurons with distinct colors in the same field of view of a brain [1, 2]. Reconstruction (or "tracing") of the 3D structures of these images has been enabled by a growing set of software tools for automatic and manual annotation. It is common, however, to have errors introduced by heuristics used by tracing software, namely that they assume the "best" path is the highest intensity one, a more pertinent issue when dealing with multicolor microscope images. Here, we report nCorrect, an algorithm for correcting this error by reanalyzing previously created neuron traces to produce more physiologically-relevant ones. Specifically, we use a four dimensional minimization algorithm to identify a more-optimal reconstruction of the image, allowing us to better take advantage of existing manual tracing results. We define a new metric (hyperspectral cosine similarity) for describing the similarity of different neuron colors to each other. Our code is available in an open source license and forms the basis for future improved neuron tracing software.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial memory consolidation during REM sleep requires stabilization of newly formed place cells.</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms behind the role of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMs) in spatial memory formation are unclear. Here, we performed hippocampal CA1 single-unit recordings in mice expressing archaerhodopsin in GABAergic neurons of the medial septum (MSGABA), an established optogenetic method enabling REMs-selective theta rhythm attenuation resulting in spatial memory deficits. Analysis of CA1 neural assemblies during REMs revealed reduced synchrony of constituent neural activity during MSGABA silencing. Subsequent investigation of recently formed CA1 place cells demonstrated that REMs-selective MSGABA inhibition reduced the place stability of those which participated in prior REMs assembly activity, but not of those which did not. This suggests that CA1 neural assemblies during REMs facilitate spatial memory formation by stabilizing spatial representations in a plastic subpopulation of participating CA1 neurons.

                Current assessments of interocular interactions in amblyopia use rivalrous stimuli, with conflicting stimuli in each eye, which does not reflect vision under typical circumstances. Here we measure interocular interactions in observers with amblyopia, strabismus with equal vision, and controls using a non-rivalrous stimulus. Observers used a joystick to continuously report perceived contrast of dichoptic grating stimuli, identical except that the stimulus was contrast-modulated independently in each eye over time. Consistent with previous studies, a model predicting the time-course of perceived contrast found increased amblyopic eye attenuation, and reduced contrast normalization of the fellow eye by the amblyopic eye, in amblyopic participants compared to controls. However, these suppressive interocular effects were weaker than those found in previous studies, suggesting that rivalrous stimuli may overestimate the effects of amblyopia on interocular interactions during naturalistic viewing conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subcortical circuit dysfunctions delay perceptual decision-making in autism models</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include a range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterised by social and communication difficulties1, often co-occurring with sensory processing abnormalities2. The neural origins of these impairments are thought to reside in cortical circuits3-5. Here we demonstrate that a subcortical node required to initiate efficient and timely responses to visual threats is disrupted across genetic models of ASD. Although mutant animals can detect visual threat stimuli, they require longer to evaluate them and respond with less vigour than their wild-type siblings. These delays in perceptual judgement are linked to reduced place-aversion to visual threats. Visual responses and other motor properties remain unaffected, overall indicating cognitive rather than sensory or motor impairments. Focusing on one of the models (Setd5), we show that these behavioural deficits are recapitulated following optogenetic activation of excitatory deep medial collicular neurons, known to initiate threat responses by exciting the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG). Consistently, ex vivo patch-clamp recordings of Setd5 mutant dPAG neurons revealed a stark hypoexcitability phenotype mediated by misregulation of a voltage-gated potassium channel. Our results show that the timing of perceptual decision-making is regulated via intrinsic excitability, mechanistically dissecting a cognitive disorder through an instinctive behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding brain basis of laughter and crying in natural scenes.</a></h4>

              
                Laughter and crying are universal signals of prosociality and distress, respectively. Here we investigated the functional brain basis of perceiving laughter and crying using naturalistic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach. We measured haemodynamic brain activity evoked by laughter and crying in three experiments with 100 subjects in each. The subjects i) viewed a 20-minute medley of short video clips, and ii) 30 minutes of a full-length feature film, and iii) listened to 15 minutes of a radio play that all contained bursts of laughter and crying. Intensity of laughing and crying in the videos and radio play was annotated by independent observes, and the resulting time series were used to predict hemodynamic activity to laughter and crying episodes. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to test for regional selectivity in laughter and crying evoked activations. Laughter induced widespread activity in ventral visual cortex and superior and middle temporal and motor cortices. Crying activated thalamus, cingulate cortex along the anterior-posterior axis, insula and orbitofrontal cortex. Both laughter and crying could be decoded accurately (66-77% depending on the experiment) from the BOLD signal, and the voxels contributing most significantly to classification were in superior temporal cortex. These results suggest that perceiving laughter and crying engage distinct neural networks, whose activity suppresses each other to manage appropriate behavioral responses to others bonding and distress signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Timing matters: Sex differences in acute and chronic outcomes following repetitive blast mild traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Background: Repetitive blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) caused by exposure to high explosives is increasingly common among warfighters as well as civilians. While women have been serving in military positions with increased risk of blast exposure since 2016, there are few published reports examining sex as a biological variable in models of blast mTBI, greatly limiting diagnosis and treatment capabilities. As such, here we examined acute and chronic outcomes of repetitive blast trauma in female and male mice in relation to potential behavioral, inflammatory, microbiome, and vascular dysfunction. Methods: In this study we utilized a well-established blast overpressure model to induce repetitive (3x) blast-mTBI in both female and male mice. Acutely following repetitive exposure, we measured serum and brain cytokine levels, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, fecal microbial abundance, and locomotion and anxiety-like behavior in the open field assay. Chronically, in female and male mice we assessed behavioral correlates of mTBI and PTSD-related symptoms commonly reported by Veterans with a history of blast-mTBI using the elevated zero maze, acoustic startle, and conditioned odorant aversion paradigms. Results: Repetitive blast exposure resulted in similar and disparate patterns of acute serum and brain cytokine as well as gut microbiome changes in female and male mice. Acute BBB disruption following repetitive blast exposure was apparent in both sexes. While female and male blast mice both exhibited acute locomotor and anxiety-like deficits in the open field assay, only male mice exhibited chronic adverse behavioral outcomes. Discussion: Representing a novel survey of potential sex differences following repetitive blast trauma, our results demonstrate unique similar and divergent patterns of blast-induced dysfunction in female vs. male mice and highlight novel targets for future diagnosis and therapeutic development.

                The cEEGrid (ear-electroencephalography; ear-EEG) is an unobtrusive and comfortable electrode array affixed around the ear. It is suited to investigate brain activity outside of the laboratory for long durations. Previous research established that cEEGrids can be used to study various cognitive processes in and also beyond the lab, even for a whole day. To record high-quality ear-EEG data, careful preparation is necessary. In this protocol, we explain the steps needed for successful experimenting with cEEGrids: First, we show how to test the functionality of the cEEGrid prior to a recording. Second, we describe how to prepare the participant and to fit the cEEGrid, which is the most important step to record high-quality data. Third, we outline how to connect the cEEGrids to the amplifier and how to check the signal quality. In this protocol, we give best practice recommendations and tips that make cEEGrid recordings easier. If researchers follow this protocol, they are comprehensively equipped for experimenting with the cEEGrid in and beyond the lab.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Cre-Driver Rat Model for Anatomical and Functional Analysis of Glucagon (Gcg)-Expressing Cells in the Brain and Periphery</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The glucagon gene (Gcg) encodes preproglucagon, which is cleaved to form glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) and other mature signaling molecules implicated in metabolic functions. To date there are no transgenic rat models available for precise manipulation of GLP1-expressing cells in the brain and periphery. Methods: To visualize and manipulate Gcg-expressing cells in rats, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to express iCre under control of the Gcg promoter. Gcg-Cre rats were bred with tdTomato reporter rats to tag Gcg-expressing cells. Cre-dependent AAVs and RNAscope in situ hybridization were used to evaluate the specificity of iCre expression by GLP1 neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) and intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt), and by intestinal and pancreatic secretory cells. Food intake was assessed in heterozygous (Het) Gcg-Cre rats after chemogenetic stimulation of cNTS GLP1 neurons expressing an excitatory DREADD. Results: While genotype has minimal effect on body weight or composition in chow-fed Gcg-Cre rats, homozygous (Homo) rats have lower plasma glucose levels. In neonatal and adult Gcg-Cre/tdTom rats, reporter-labeled cells are present in the cNTS and IRt, and in additional brain regions (e.g., basolateral amygdala, piriform cortex) that lack detectable Gcg mRNA in adults but display transient developmental or persistently low Gcg expression. Compared to wildtype (WT) rats, hindbrain Gcg mRNA and GLP1 protein in brain and plasma are markedly reduced in Homo Gcg-Cre rats. Chemogenetic stimulation of cNTS GLP1 neurons reduced overnight chow intake in males but not females, the effect in males was blocked by antagonism of central GLP1 receptors, and hypophagia was enhanced when combined with a subthreshold dose of cholecystokinin-8 to stimulate gastrointestinal vagal afferents. Conclusions: Gcg-Cre rats are a novel and valuable experimental tool for analyzing the development, anatomy, and function of Gcg-expressing cells in the brain and periphery. In addition, Homo Gcg-Cre rats are a unique model for assessing the role of Gcg-encoded proteins in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel pH-sensitive reporter reveals the cocaine-regulated trafficking of dopamine transporters in neuronal processes</a></h4>

              
                The dopamine transporter (DAT) mediated DA reuptake is a major molecular mechanism for termination of dopaminergic signaling in the brain. Psychoactive substances such as cocaine act by inhibition of plasma membrane DAT function as well as by altering its expression. The precise manner and mechanism by which cocaine regulates DAT trafficking, especially at neuronal processes, are poorly understood. We have now engineered a novel pH-sensitive reporter for DAT by conjugating pHluorin to the second exofacial loop of human DAT. We show that DAT-pHluorin can be used to study DAT localization and its dynamic trafficking at neuronal processes. Using DAT-pHluorin we show that unlike neuronal soma and dendrites, which contain majority of the DATs in weakly acidic intracellular compartments, axonal DATs at both shafts and boutons are primarily (75%) localized to the plasma membrane, while varicosities contain abundant intracellular DAT within acidic intracellular structures. Using this novel reporter, we show, for the first time, that cocaine exposure leads to a brief DAT internalization followed by membrane reinsertion that lasts for days. We further show that the cocaine-induced DAT trafficking is sensitive to the activities of Synaptojanin1 phosphatase. Thus, our study using the newly engineered DAT optical reporter reveals the previously unknown dynamics and molecular regulation for cocaine-regulated DAT trafficking in neuronal processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inability to make facial expressions dampens emotion perception.</a></h4>

              
                Humans rely heavily on facial expressions for social communication to convey their thoughts and emotions and to understand them in others. One prominent but controversial view is that humans learn to recognize the significance of facial expressions by mimicking the expressions of others. This view predicts that an inability to make facial expressions (e.g., facial paralysis) would result in reduced perceptual sensitivity to others' facial expressions. To test this hypothesis, we developed a diverse battery of sensitive emotion recognition tasks to characterize emotion perception in individuals with Moebius Syndrome (MBS), a congenital neurological disorder that causes facial palsy. Using computer-based emotion detection tasks we systematically assessed emotion perception thresholds for static and dynamic face and body expressions. We found that while MBS individuals were able to perform challenging perceptual control tasks, they were less efficient at extracting emotion from facial expressions, compared to matched controls. Exploratory analyses of fMRI data from a small group of MBS participants suggested potentially reduced engagement of the amygdala in MBS participants during expression processing relative to matched controls. Collectively, these results support the role of facial mimicry and consequent facial feedback and motor experience in the perception of others' expressions.

Previous work proposed that the multisensory neurons in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MST-d) serve as integration or separation encoders determined by the tuning&amp;amp;ndash;response ratio. However, it remains unclear whether MST-d neurons mainly take a sense input as a spatial coordinate reference for carrying out multisensory integration or separation. Our experimental analysis shows that the preferred tuning response to visual input is generally larger than vestibular according to the Macaque MST-d neuronal recordings. This may be crucial to serving as the base of coordinate reference when the subject perceives moving direction information from two senses. By constructing a flexible Monte-Carlo probabilistic sampling (fMCS) model, we validate this hypothesis that the visual and vestibular cues are more likely to be integrated into a visual-based coordinate rather than vestibular. Furthermore, the property of the tuning gradient also affects decision-making regarding whether the cues should be integrated or not. To a dominant modality, an effective decision is produced by a steep response-tuning gradient of the corresponding neurons, while to a subordinate modality a steep tuning gradient produces a rigid decision with a significant bias to either integration or separation. This work proposes that the tuning response amplitude and tuning gradient jointly modulate which modality serves as the base coordinate for the reference frame and the direction change with which modality is decoded effectively.</p>

	<p>Sleep has a major impact on a variety of human biological and cognitive functions. In particular, its impact on memory has attracted extensive research and has been amply demonstrated. However, it is still unclear whether sleep, or lack thereof, affects the ability to recognize faces. To clarify this, we conducted a scoping review on studies that included a face recognition memory task and any kind of sleep manipulation in adults without any sleep pathology. A systematic search and synthesis of peer-reviewed journal articles identified through the electronic databases Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, and PubMed was performed. A final sample of 18 articles, corresponding to 19 studies, met the eligibility criteria. The results of 13 articles suggested that sleep benefited face recognition ability, whereas two articles indicated a detrimental effect of sleep on performance, and four articles found no significant effects. This review highlights the high methodological variability between studies, in terms of sleep manipulation, retention interval, tasks used to probe face recognition, and other variables. In sum, although around one third of the studies show a beneficial effect of sleep on memory for faces, we suggest that future research should invest in replicating these findings with a stricter control of potentially confounding variables to allow stronger conclusions to be drawn.</p>

	<p>Integration of sensory signals that emanate from the same source, such as the visual of lip articulations and the sound of the voice of a speaking individual, can improve perception of the source signal (e.g., speech). Because momentary sensory inputs are typically corrupted with internal and external noise, there is almost always a discrepancy between the inputs, facing the perceptual system with the problem of determining whether the two signals were caused by the same source or different sources. Thus, whether or not multisensory stimuli are integrated and the degree to which they are bound is influenced by factors such as the prior expectation of a common source. We refer to this factor as the tendency to bind stimuli, or for short, binding tendency. In theory, the tendency to bind sensory stimuli can be learned by experience through the acquisition of the probabilities of the co-occurrence of the stimuli. It can also be influenced by cognitive knowledge of the environment. The binding tendency varies across individuals and can also vary within an individual over time. Here, we review the studies that have investigated the plasticity of binding tendency. We discuss the protocols that have been reported to produce changes in binding tendency, the candidate learning mechanisms involved in this process, the possible neural correlates of binding tendency, and outstanding questions pertaining to binding tendency and its plasticity. We conclude by proposing directions for future research and argue that understanding mechanisms and recipes for increasing binding tendency can have important clinical and translational applications for populations or individuals with a deficiency in multisensory integration.</p>

	<p>Apathy is the commonest neuropsychiatric symptom in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Previous findings suggest that apathy is caused by a communication breakdown between functional neural networks involved in motivational&amp;amp;ndash;affective processing. This study investigated the relationship between white matter (WM) damage and apathy in AD. Sixty-one patients with apathy (AP-PT) and 61 without apathy (NA-PT) were identified from the Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and matched for cognitive status, age and education. Sixty-one cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants were also included as controls. Data on cognitive performance, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, brain/WM hyperintensity volumes and diffusion tensor imaging indices were compared across groups. No neurocognitive differences were found between patient groups, but the AP-PT group had more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. Compared with CU participants, only apathetic patients had deficits on the Clock Drawing Test. AP-PT had increased WM damage, both macrostructurally, i.e., larger WM hyperintensity volume, and microstructurally, i.e., increased radial/axial diffusivity and reduced fractional anisotropy in the fornix, cingulum, anterior thalamic radiations and superior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi. AP-PT showed signs of extensive WM damage, especially in associative tracts in the frontal lobes, fornix and cingulum. Disruption in structural connectivity might affect crucial functional inter-network communication, resulting in motivational deficits and worse cognitive decline.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Compromised endocytosis in neurons leads to synapse overgrowth and altered organization of synaptic proteins. However, the molecular players and the signaling pathways which regulate the process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that 2-adaptin, one of the subunits of the AP2-complex, genetically interacts with Mad, Medea and Dad (components of BMP signaling) to control neuromuscular junction (NMJ) growth in <I>Drosophila</I>. Ultrastructural analysis of <I>2-adaptin</I> mutants show an accumulation of large vesicles and membranous structures akin to endosomes at the synapse. We found that mutations in <I>2-adaptin</I> lead to an accumulation of Tkv receptors at the presynaptic membrane. Interestingly, the level of small GTPase Rab11 was significantly reduced in the <I>2-adaptin</I> mutant synapses. However, expression of Rab11 does not restore the synaptic defects of <I>2-adaptin</I> mutations. We propose a model in which AP2 regulates Tkv internalization and endosomal recycling to control synaptic growth.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Experiments employing chronic monitoring of neurophysiological signals and video are commonly used in studies of epilepsy to characterize behavioral correlates of seizures. Our objective was to design a low-cost platform that enables chronic monitoring of several animals simultaneously, synchronizes bilateral local field potential (LFP) and video streams in real time, and parses recorded data into manageable file sizes. We present a hardware solution leveraging Intan and Open Ephys acquisition systems and a software solution implemented in Bonsai. The platform was tested in 48-h continuous recordings simultaneously from multiple mice (male and female) with chronic epilepsy. To enable seizure detection and scoring, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that reads the data produced by our workflow and allows a user with no coding expertise to analyze events. Our Bonsai workflow was designed to maximize flexibility for a wide variety of experimental applications, and our use of the Open Ephys acquisition board would allow for scaling recordings up to 128 channels per animal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spike Afterhyperpolarizations Govern Persistent Firing Dynamics in Rat Neocortical and Hippocampal Pyramidal Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Persistent firing is commonly reported in both cortical and subcortical neurons under a variety of behavioral conditions. Yet the mechanisms responsible for persistent activity are only partially resolved with support for both intrinsic and synaptic circuit-based mechanisms. Little also is known about physiological factors that enable epochs of persistent firing to continue beyond brief pauses and then spontaneously terminate. In the present study, we used intracellular recordings in rat (both sexes) neocortical and hippocampal brain slices to assess the ionic mechanisms underlying persistent firing dynamics. Previously, we showed that blockade of ether-&aacute;-go-go-related gene (ERG) potassium channels abolished intrinsic persistent firing in the presence of low concentrations of muscarinic receptor agonists and following optogenetic activation of cholinergic axons. Here we show the slow dynamics of ERG conductance changes allows persistent firing to outlast the triggering stimulus and even to initiate discharges following ~7 s poststimulus firing pauses. We find that persistent firing dynamics is regulated by the interaction between ERG conductance and spike afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs). Increasing the amplitude of spike AHPs using either SK channel activators or a closed-loop reactive feedback system allows persistent discharges to spontaneously terminate in both neocortical neurons and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. The interplay between ERG and the potassium channels that mediate spike AHPs grades the duration of persistent firing, providing a novel, generalizable mechanism to explain self-terminating persistent firing modes observed behaving animals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many classes of neurons generate prolonged spiking responses to transient stimuli. These discharges often outlast the stimulus by seconds to minutes in some <I>in vitro</I> models of persistent firing. While recent work has identified key synaptic and intrinsic components that enable persistent spiking responses, less is known about mechanisms that can terminate and regulate the dynamics of these responses. The present study identified the spike afterhyperpolarizations as a potent mechanism that regulates the duration of persistent firing. We found that amplifying spike afterpotentials converted bistable persistent firing into self-terminating discharges. Varying the spike AHP amplitude grades the duration of persistent discharges, generating <I>in vitro</I> responses that mimic firing modes associated with neurons associated with short-term memory function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oxytocin-Modulated Ion Channel Ensemble Controls Depolarization, Integration and Burst Firing in CA2 Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxytocin (OXT) and OXT receptor (OXTR)-mediated signaling control excitability, firing patterns, and plasticity of hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons, which are pivotal in generation of brain oscillations and social memory. Nonetheless, the ionic mechanisms underlying OXTR-induced effects in CA2 neurons are not fully understood. Using slice physiology in a reporter mouse line and interleaved current-clamp and voltage-clamp experiments, we systematically identified the ion channels modulated by OXT signaling in CA2 pyramidal cells (PYRs) in mice of both sexes and explored how changes in channel conductance support altered electrical activity. Activation of OXTRs inhibits an outward potassium current mediated by inward rectifier potassium channels (<I>I</I><SUB>Kir</SUB>) and thus favoring membrane depolarization. Concomitantly, OXT signaling also diminishes inward current mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>), providing a hyperpolarizing drive. The combined reduction in both <I>I</I><SUB>Kir</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> synergistically elevate the membrane resistance and favor dendritic integration while the membrane potential is restrained from quickly depolarizing from rest. As a result, the responsiveness of CA2 PYRs to synaptic inputs is highly sharpened during OXTR activation. Unexpectedly, OXTR signaling also strongly enhances a tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R), voltage-gated sodium current that helps drive the membrane potential to spike threshold and thus promote rhythmic firing. This novel array of OXTR-stimulated ionic mechanisms operates in close coordination and underpins OXT-induced burst firing, a key step in CA2 PYRs' contribution to hippocampal information processing and broader influence on brain circuitry. Our study deepens our understanding of underpinnings of OXT-promoted social memory and general neuropeptidergic control of cognitive states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oxytocin (OXT) plays key roles in reproduction, parenting and social and emotional behavior, and deficiency in OXT receptor (OXTR) signaling may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. We identified a novel array of OXTR-modulated ion channels that operate in close coordination to retune hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons, enhancing responsiveness to synaptic inputs and sculpting output. OXTR signaling inhibits both potassium conductance (<I>I</I><SUB>Kir</SUB>) and mixed cation conductance (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>), engaging opposing influences on membrane potential, stabilizing it while synergistically elevating membrane resistance and electrotonic spread. OXT signaling also facilitates a tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na<sup>+</sup> current, not previously described in hippocampus (HP), engaged on further depolarization. This TTX-R current lowers the spike threshold and supports rhythmic depolarization and burst firing, a potent driver of downstream circuitry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cerebellar GABA Change during Visuomotor Adaptation Relates to Adaptation Performance and Cerebellar Network Connectivity: A Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor adaptation is crucial for performing accurate movements in a changing environment and relies on the cerebellum. Although cerebellar involvement has been well characterized, the neurochemical changes in the cerebellum underpinning human motor adaptation remain unknown. We used a novel magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) technique to measure changes in the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the human cerebellum during visuomotor adaptation. Participants (<I>n</I> = 17, six female) used their right hand to adapt to a rotated cursor in the scanner, compared with a control task requiring no adaptation. We spatially resolved adaptation-driven GABA changes at the cerebellar nuclei and cerebellar cortex in the left and the right cerebellar hemisphere independently and found that simple right-hand movements increase GABA in the right cerebellar nuclei and decreases GABA in the left. When isolating adaptation-driven GABA changes, we found that GABA in the left cerebellar nuclei and the right cerebellar nuclei diverged, although GABA change from baseline at the right cerebellar nuclei was not different from zero at the group level. Early adaptation-driven GABA fluctuations in the right cerebellar nuclei correlated with adaptation performance. Participants showing greater GABA decrease adapted better, suggesting early GABA change is behaviorally relevant. Early GABA change also correlated with functional connectivity change in a cerebellar network. Participants showing greater decreases in GABA showed greater strength increases in cerebellar network connectivity. Results were specific to GABA, to adaptation, and to the cerebellar network. This study provides first evidence for plastic changes in cerebellar neurochemistry during motor adaptation. Characterizing these naturally occurring neurochemical changes may provide a basis for developing therapeutic interventions to facilitate human motor adaptation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite motor adaptation being fundamental to maintaining accurate movements, its neurochemical basis remains poorly understood, perhaps because measuring neurochemicals in the human cerebellum is technically challenging. Using a novel magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method, this study provides evidence for GABA changes in the left compared with the right cerebellar nuclei driven by both simple movement and motor adaptation. Although right cerebellar GABA changes were not significantly different from zero at the group level, the adaptation-driven GABA fluctuations in the right cerebellar nuclei correlated with adaptation performance and with functional connectivity change in a cerebellar network. These results show the first evidence for plastic changes in cerebellar neurochemistry during a cerebellar learning task. This provides the basis for developing therapeutic interventions that facilitate these naturally occurring changes to amplify cerebellar-dependent learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Axonal Barcode Analysis of Pyramidal Tract Projections from Mouse Forelimb M1 and M2</a></h4>

              
                <p>Forelimb-related areas of the motor cortex communicate directly to downstream areas in the brainstem and spinal cord via axons that project to and through the pyramidal tract (PT). To better understand the diversity of the brainstem branching patterns of these pyramidal tract projections, we used MAPseq, a molecular barcode technique for population-scale sampling with single-axon resolution. In experiments using mice of both sexes, we first confirmed prior results demonstrating the basic efficacy of axonal barcode identification of primary motor cortex (M1) PT-type axons, including corticobulbar (CBULB) and corticospinal (CSPI) subclasses. We then used multiplexed MAPseq to analyze projections from M1 and M2 (caudal and rostral forelimb areas). The four basic axon subclasses comprising these projections (M1-CSPI, M1-CBULB, M2-CSPI, M2-CBULB) showed a complex mix of differences and similarities in their brainstem projection profiles. This included relatively abundant branching by all classes in the dorsal midbrain, by M2 subclasses in the pons, and by CSPI subclasses in the dorsal medulla. Cluster analysis showed graded distributions of the basic subclasses within the PT class. Clusters were of diversely mixed subclass composition and showed distinct rostrocaudal and/or dorsomedial projection biases. Exemplifying these patterns was a subcluster likely enriched in corticocuneate branches. Overall, the results indicate high yet systematic PT axon diversity at the level of brainstem branching patterns; projections of M1 and M2 appear qualitatively similar, yet with quantitative differences in subclasses and clusters.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Axons of the PT class of cortical projection neurons, which includes corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons, anatomically link motor cortex to brainstem and spinal cord circuits. Both of these subclasses can form branches to brainstem destinations along the way, but the extent and diversity of these branching patterns is incompletely understood. Here, we used MAPseq to tag PT axons with individual molecular barcodes for high-throughput quantification of branching patterns across the brainstem. The results reveal diverse, complex, yet systematic branching patterns of corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons arising from two motor cortex areas, M1 and M2.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cannabinoids and Opioids Differentially Target Extrinsic and Intrinsic GABAergic Inputs onto the Periaqueductal Grey Descending Pathway</a></h4>

              
                <p>The midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) plays a central role in pain modulation via descending pathways. Opioids and cannabinoids are thought to activate these descending pathways by relieving intrinsic GABAergic inhibition of PAG neurons which project to the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM), a process known as disinhibition. However, the PAG also receives descending extrinsic GABAergic inputs from the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) which are thought to inhibit PAG GABAergic interneurons. It remains unclear how opioids and cannabinoids act at these different synapses to control descending analgesic pathways. We used optogenetics, tract tracing and electrophysiology to identify the circuitry underlying opioid and cannabinoid actions within the PAG of male and female rats. It was observed that both RVM-projection and nonprojection PAG neurons received intrinsic-PAG and extrinsic-CeA synaptic inputs, which were predominantly GABAergic. Opioids acted via presynaptic &micro;-receptors to suppress both intrinsic and extrinsic GABAergic inputs onto all PAG neurons, although this inhibition was greater in RVM-projection neurons. By contrast, cannabinoids acted via presynaptic CB1 receptors to exclusively suppress the direct descending GABAergic input from the CeA onto RVM-projection PAG neurons. These findings indicate the CeA controls PAG output neurons which project to the RVM via parallel direct and indirect GABAergic pathways. While &micro;-opioids indiscriminately inhibit GABAergic inputs onto all PAG neurons, cannabinoids selectively inhibit a direct extrinsic GABAergic input from the amygdala onto PAG projection neurons. These differential actions of opioids and cannabinoids provide a flexible system to gate the descending control of analgesia from the PAG.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The disinhibition hypothesis of analgesia states that opioids activate the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) descending pathway by relieving the tonic inhibition of projection neurons from GABAergic interneurons. However, the PAG also receives extrinsic GABAergic inputs and is the locus of action of cannabinoid analgesics. Here, we show the relative sensitivity of GABAergic synapses to opioids and cannabinoids within the PAG depends on both the origin of presynaptic inputs and their postsynaptic targets. While opioids indiscriminately inhibit all GABAergic inputs onto all PAG neurons, cannabinoids selectively inhibit a direct extrinsic GABAergic input from the amygdala onto PAG descending projection neurons. These differential actions of opioids and cannabinoids provide a flexible system to gate PAG descending outputs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Combinatorial Input Landscape in the "Higher-Order Relay" Posterior Thalamic Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>All pathways targeting the thalamus terminate directly onto the thalamic projection cells. As these cells lack local excitatory interconnections, their computations are fundamentally defined by the type and local convergence patterns of the extrinsic inputs. These two key variables, however, remain poorly defined for the "higher-order relay" (HO) nuclei that constitute most of the thalamus in large-brained mammals, including humans. Here, we systematically analyzed the input landscape of a representative HO nucleus of the mouse thalamus, the posterior nucleus (Po). We examined in adult male and female mice the neuropil distribution of terminals immunopositive for markers of excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission, mapped input sources across the brain and spinal cord and compared the intranuclear distribution and varicosity size of axons originated from each input source. Our findings reveal a complex landscape of partly overlapping input-specific microdomains. Cortical layer (L)5 afferents from somatosensory and motor areas predominate in central and ventral Po but are relatively less abundant in dorsal and lateral portions of the nucleus. Excitatory inputs from the trigeminal complex, dorsal column nuclei (DCN), spinal cord and superior colliculus as well as inhibitory terminals from anterior pretectal nucleus and zona incerta (ZI) are each abundant in specific Po regions and absent from others. Cortical L6 and reticular thalamic nucleus terminals are evenly distributed across Po. Integration of specific input motifs by particular cell subpopulations may be commonplace within HO nuclei and favor the emergence of multiple, functionally diverse input-output subnetworks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Because thalamic projection neurons lack local interconnections, their output is essentially determined by the kind and convergence of the long-range inputs that they receive. Fragmentary evidence suggests that these parameters may vary within the "higher-order relay" (HO) nuclei that constitute much of the thalamus, but such variation has not been systematically analyzed. Here, we mapped the origin and local convergence of all the extrinsic inputs reaching the posterior nucleus (Po), a typical HO nucleus of the mouse thalamus by combining multiple neuropil labeling and axon tracing methods. We report a complex mosaic of partly overlapping input-specific domains within Po. Integration of different input motifs by specific cell subpopulations in HO nuclei may favor the emergence of multiple, computationally specialized thalamocortical subnetworks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">General Auditory and Speech-Specific Contributions to Cortical Envelope Tracking Revealed Using Auditory Chimeras</a></h4>

              
                <p>In recent years research on natural speech processing has benefited from recognizing that low-frequency cortical activity tracks the amplitude envelope of natural speech. However, it remains unclear to what extent this tracking reflects speech-specific processing beyond the analysis of the stimulus acoustics. In the present study, we aimed to disentangle contributions to cortical envelope tracking that reflect general acoustic processing from those that are functionally related to processing speech. To do so, we recorded EEG from subjects as they listened to auditory chimeras, stimuli composed of the temporal fine structure of one speech stimulus modulated by the amplitude envelope (ENV) of another speech stimulus. By varying the number of frequency bands used in making the chimeras, we obtained some control over which speech stimulus was recognized by the listener. No matter which stimulus was recognized, envelope tracking was always strongest for the ENV stimulus, indicating a dominant contribution from acoustic processing. However, there was also a positive relationship between intelligibility and the tracking of the perceived speech, indicating a contribution from speech-specific processing. These findings were supported by a follow-up analysis that assessed envelope tracking as a function of the (estimated) output of the cochlea rather than the original stimuli used in creating the chimeras. Finally, we sought to isolate the speech-specific contribution to envelope tracking using forward encoding models and found that indices of phonetic feature processing tracked reliably with intelligibility. Together these results show that cortical speech tracking is dominated by acoustic processing but also reflects speech-specific processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activity in auditory cortex is known to dynamically track the energy fluctuations, or amplitude envelope, of speech. Measures of this tracking are now widely used in research on hearing and language and have had a substantial influence on theories of how auditory cortex parses and processes speech. But how much of this speech tracking is actually driven by speech-specific processing rather than general acoustic processing is unclear, limiting its interpretability and its usefulness. Here, by merging two speech stimuli together to form so-called auditory chimeras, we show that EEG tracking of the speech envelope is dominated by acoustic processing but also reflects linguistic analysis. This has important implications for theories of cortical speech tracking and for using measures of that tracking in applied research.</p>
