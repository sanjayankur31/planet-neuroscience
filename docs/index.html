                Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), one of the major extracellular matrix components of the glial scar that surrounds central nervous system (CNS) injuries, are known to inhibit the regeneration of neurons. This study investigated whether pleiotrophin (PTN), a growth factor upregulated during early CNS development, can overcome the inhibition mediated by CSPGs and promote the neurite outgrowth of neurons in vitro. The data showed that a CSPG matrix inhibited the outgrowth of neurites in primary cortical neuron cultures compared to a control matrix. PTN elicited a dose dependent increase in the neurite outgrowth even in the presence of the growth inhibitory CSPG matrix, with optimal growth at 15 ng mL-1 of PTN (114.8% of neuronal outgrowth relative to laminin control). The growth promoting effect of PTN was blocked by inhibition of the receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) by alectinib in a dose dependent manner. Neurite outgrowth in the presence of this CSPG matrix was induced by activation of the protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, a key downstream mediator of ALK activation. This study identified PTN as a dose-dependent regulator of neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neurons cultured in the presence of a CSPG matrix, and identified ALK activation as a key driver of PTN-induced growth

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of C5a-C5aR1 signaling alters the dynamics of AD progression</a></h4>

              
                Background: The complement system is part of the innate immune system that clears pathogens and cellular debris. In the healthy brain, complement influences neurodevelopment and neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, clearance of neuronal blebs, recruitment of phagocytes, and protects from pathogens. However, excessive downstream complement activation that leads to generation of C5a, and C5a engagement with its receptor C5aR1, instigates a feed-forward loop of inflammation, injury, and neuronal death, making C5aR1 a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory disorders. C5aR1 ablation in the Arctic (Arc) model of Alzheimers disease protects against cognitive decline and neuronal injury without altering amyloid plaque accumulation. Methods: To elucidate the effects of C5a-C5aR1 signaling on AD pathology, we crossed Arc mice with a C5a overexpressing mouse (ArcC5a+) and tested hippocampal memory. RNA-seq was performed on hippocampus and cortex from Arc, ArcC5aR1KO, and ArcC5a+ mice at 2.7-10 months and age-matched controls to assess mechanisms involved in each system. Immunohistochemistry was used to probe for protein markers of microglia and astrocytes activation states. Results: ArcC5a+ mice had accelerated cognitive decline compared to Arc. Deletion of C5ar1 delayed or prevented the expression of some, but not all, AD-associated genes in the hippocampus and a subset of pan-reactive and A1 reactive astrocyte genes, indicating a separation between genes induced by amyloid plaques alone and those influenced by C5a-C5aR1 signaling. Biological processes associated with AD and AD mouse models, including inflammatory signaling, microglial cell activation, and astrocyte migration, were delayed in the ArcC5aR1KO hippocampus. Interestingly, C5a overexpression also delayed the increase of some AD-, complement-, and astrocyte-associated genes, suggesting the possible involvement of neuroprotective C5aR2. However, these pathways were enhanced in older ArcC5a+ mice compared to Arc. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that C5a-C5aR1 modulation in Arc mice delayed the increase in CD11c-positive microglia, while not affecting other pan-reactive microglial or astrocyte markers. Conclusion: C5a-C5aR1 signaling in AD largely exerts its effects by enhancing microglial activation pathways that accelerate disease progression. While C5a may have neuroprotective effects via C5aR2, engagement of C5a with C5aR1 is detrimental in AD models. These data support specific pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-Individual Variability in Dorsal Stream Dynamics During Word Production</a></h4>

              
                The current standard model of language production involves a sensorimotor dorsal stream connecting areas in the temporo-parietal junction with those in the inferior frontal gyrus and lateral premotor cortex. These regions have been linked to various aspects of word production such as phonological processing or articulatory programming, primarily through neuropsychological and functional imaging group studies. Most if not all the theoretical descriptions of this model imply that the same network should be identifiable across individual speakers. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the variability of activation observed across individuals within each dorsal stream anatomical region. This estimate was based on electrical activity recorded directly from the cerebral cortex with millisecond accuracy in awake epileptic patients clinically implanted with intracerebral depth electrodes for pre-surgical diagnosis. Each region's activity was quantified using two different metrics, intra-cerebral evoked related potentials and high gamma activity, at the level of the group, the individual, and the recording contact. Using picture naming task, the two metrics show simultaneous activation of parietal and frontal regions in line with models that posit interactive processing during word retrieval. They also reveal different levels of variability across brain regions and patients except in auditory and motor regions. The independence and non-uniformity of cortical activity according to the two metrics push the current model towards sub-second and sub-region explorations focused on individualized language speech production. Several hypotheses are considered for this within-region heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explaining flexible continuous speech comprehension from individual motor rhythms</a></h4>

              
                When speech is too fast, the tracking of the acoustic signal along the auditory pathway deteriorates, leading to suboptimal speech segmentation and decoding of speech information. Thus, speech comprehension is limited by the temporal constraints of the auditory system. Previous research suggests that individual differences in auditory-motor coupling strength might shape such temporal constraints. In two behavioral experiments, we characterize individual differences in the comprehension of naturalistic speech as function of the individual coupling strength between the auditory and motor systems, and the preferred frequencies of the systems. As expected, speech comprehension declined at higher rates. Importantly, both, higher auditory-motor coupling and higher spontaneous speech motor production rates were related to better speech-comprehension performance. Furthermore, performance increased with higher linguistic sentence predictability (using a recurrent neural network) -particularly at higher speech rates and for individuals with high auditory-motor coupling strength- and with participants' higher working memory capacity (Digit Span). These findings support the notion of an individual preferred auditory regime that allows for optimal auditory (speech) processing. Crucially, we provide evidence for a model that assigns a central role to motor-system-dependent individual flexibility in continuous speech comprehension.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Late maturation of executive control promotes conceptual development</a></h4>

              
                Control processes are critical for the generation of task-appropriate behaviour across cognitive domains, yet children have a long developmental period with reduced executive control. Traditionally, this is viewed as a negative but necessary consequence of the time taken to learn control processes and develop the prefrontal cortex. Here, we exploit a recent computational model of controlled semantic cognition to formally test an alternative (yet perhaps complementary) view that a developmental period without control promotes conceptual knowledge acquisition. Our simulations show that maturational delay and anatomical connectivity conspire to promote conceptual learning. Learning conceptual structure necessitates a connection from control to more peripheral regions rather than the deep multimodal hub. Delayed control speeds conceptual learning without compromising conceptual representations, particularly when control connects to intermediate layers. These results are counterintuitive as delayed control onset can produce overall faster mastery of controlled behaviours. To assess whether delayed semantic control is also observed over development, we conducted a meta-analysis of the classic triadic matching task where participants decide which of two options best matches a third. Matching can be based on taxonomic or thematic relations, and when these conflict, participants must use task context to determine which relation to choose - that is, they must exert semantic control. Children aged 2 have the representations to identify both relations when distractors are unrelated, but when relations conflict, they cannot use context to guide their choices. Context-sensitivity develops later than conceptual structure and shows large increases around 6, a critical time for executive function across domains.

	<p>(1) Background: Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies have been reported to have a promising survival benefit in recent studies. Anlotinib is a new oral VEGF receptor inhibitor. This report describes our experience using HSRT and anlotinib for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM). (2) Methods: Between December 2019 and June 2020, rGBM patients were retrospectively analysed. Anlotinib was prescribed at 12 mg daily during HSRT. Adjuvant anlotinib was administered d1-14 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) after salvage treatment, and toxicity. (3) Results: Five patients were enrolled. The prescribed dose was 25.0 Gy in 5 fractions. The median number of cycles of anlotinib was 21 (14&amp;amp;ndash;33). The ORR was 100%. Three (60%) patients had the best outcome of a partial response (PR), and 2 (40%) achieved a complete response (CR). One patient died of tumour progression at the last follow-up. Two patients had grade 2 hand-foot syndrome. (4) Conclusions: Salvage HSRT combined with anlotinib showed a favourable outcome and acceptable toxicity for rGBM. A prospective phase II study (NCT04197492) is ongoing to further investigate the regimen.</p>

	<p>Associative memory (AM) is the ability to remember the relationship between previously unrelated items. AM is significantly affected by normal aging and neurodegenerative conditions, thus there is a growing interest in applying non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques for AM enhancement. A growing body of studies identifies posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as the most promising cortical target for both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) to modulate a cortico-hippocampal network that underlines AM. In that sense, theta frequency oscillatory tES protocols, targeted towards the hallmark oscillatory activity within the cortico-hippocampal network, are increasingly coming to prominence. To increase precision and effectiveness, the need for EEG guided individualization of the tES protocols is proposed. Here, we present the study protocol in which two types of personalized oscillatory tES&amp;amp;ndash;transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (otDCS), both frequency-modulated to the individual theta-band frequency (ITF), are compared to the non-oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and to the sham stimulation. The study has cross-over design with four tES conditions (tACS, otDCS, tDCS, sham), and the comprehensive set of neurophysiological (resting state EEG and AM-evoked EEG) and behavioral outcomes, including AM tasks (short-term associative memory, face&amp;amp;ndash;word, face&amp;amp;ndash;object, object-location), as well as measures of other cognitive functions (cognitive control, verbal fluency, and working memory).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Afterhyperpolarization Promotes the Firing of Mitral Cells through a Voltage-Dependent Modification of Action Potential Threshold</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In the olfactory bulb, mitral cells (MCs) display a spontaneous firing that is characterized by bursts of action potentials (APs) intermixed with silent periods. Intraburst firing frequency and duration are heterogeneous among MCs and increase with membrane depolarization. By using patch-clamp recording on rat slices, we dissected out the intrinsic properties responsible for this bursting activity. We showed that the threshold of AP generation dynamically changes as a function of the preceding trajectory of the membrane potential. In fact, the AP threshold became more negative when the membrane was hyperpolarized and had a recovery rate inversely proportional to the membrane repolarization rate. Such variations appeared to be produced by changes in the inactivation state of voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Thus, AP initiation was favored by hyperpolarizing events, such as negative membrane oscillations or inhibitory synaptic input. After the first AP, the following fast afterhyperpolarization (AHP) brought the threshold to more negative values and then promoted the emission of the following AP. This phenomenon was repeated for each AP of the burst making the fast AHP a regenerative mechanism that sustained the firing, AHP with larger amplitudes and faster repolarizations being associated with larger and higher-frequency bursts. Burst termination was found to be because of the development of a slow repolarization component of the AHP (slow AHP). Overall, the AHP characteristics appeared as a major determinant of the bursting properties.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Novel Automated Approach for Improving Standardization of the Marble Burying Test Enables Quantification of Burying Bouts and Activity Characteristics</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The marble burying test is a commonly used paradigm to describe phenotypes in mouse models of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The current methodological approach relies predominantly on reporting the number of buried marbles at the end of the test. By measuring the proxy of the behavior (buried marbles), many important characteristics regarding the temporal aspect of this assay are lost. Here, we introduce a novel, automated method to quantify mouse behavior during the marble burying test with the focus on the burying bouts and movement dynamics. Using open-source software packages, we trained a supervised machine learning algorithm (the "classifier") to distinguish burying behavior in freely moving mice. In order to confirm the classifier&rsquo;s accuracy and characterize burying events in high detail, we performed the marble burying test in three mouse models: <I>Ube3a<sup>m-/p+</sup> </I>[Angelman syndrome (AS) model], <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> (autism model), and <I>Sapap3</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> [obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) model] mice. The classifier scored burying behavior accurately and consistent with the previously reported phenotype of the <I>Ube3a<sup>m-/p+</sup> </I>mice, which showed decreased levels of burying compared with controls. <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed a similar pattern of decreased burying behavior, which was not found in <I>Sapap3</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Tracking mouse behavior throughout the test revealed hypoactivity in <I>Ube3a<sup>m-/p+</sup> </I>and hyperactivity in the <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, indicating that mouse activity is unrelated to burying behavior. Reducing activity with midazolam in <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice did not alter the burying behavior. Together, we demonstrate that our classifier is an accurate method for the analysis of the marble burying test, providing more information than currently used methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Temporally and Spatially Localized PKA Activity within Learning and Memory Circuitry Regulated by Network Feedback</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Dynamic functional connectivity within brain circuits requires coordination of intercellular signaling and intracellular signal transduction. Critical roles for cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling are well established in the <I>Drosophila</I> mushroom body (MB) learning and memory circuitry, but local PKA activity within this well-mapped neuronal network is uncharacterized. Here, we use an <I>in vivo</I> PKA activity sensor (PKA-SPARK) to test spatiotemporal regulatory requirements in the MB axon lobes. We find immature animals have little detectable PKA activity, whereas postcritical period adults show high field-selective activation primarily in just 3/16 defined output regions. In addition to the age-dependent PKA activity in distinct &alpha;&rsquo;/&beta;&rsquo; lobe nodes, females show sex-dependent elevation compared with males in these same restricted regions. Loss of neural cell body Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Rugose [human Neurobeachin (NBEA)] suppresses localized PKA activity, whereas overexpression (OE) of MB lobe PKA-synergist Meng-Po (human SBK1) promotes PKA activity. Elevated Meng-Po subverts the PKA age-dependence, with elevated activity in immature animals, and spatial-restriction, with striking  lobe activity. Testing circuit signaling requirements with temperature-sensitive <I>shibire</I> (human Dynamin) blockade, we find broadly expanded PKA activity within the MB lobes. Using transgenic tetanus toxin to block MB synaptic output, we find greatly heightened PKA activity in virtually all MB lobe fields, although the age-dependence is maintained. We conclude spatiotemporally restricted PKA activity signaling within this well-mapped learning/memory circuit is age-dependent and sex-dependent, driven by FMRP-Rugose pathway activation, temporally promoted by Meng-Po kinase function, and restricted by output neurotransmission providing network feedback.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The stochastic logistic model with correlated carrying capacities reproduces beta-diversity metrics of microbial communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Silvia Zaoli, Jacopo Grilli</p>

The large taxonomic variability of microbial community composition is a consequence of the combination of environmental variability, mediated through ecological interactions, and stochasticity. Most of the analysis aiming to infer the biological factors determining this difference in community structure start by quantifying how much communities are similar in their composition, trough beta-diversity metrics. The central role that these metrics play in microbial ecology does not parallel with a quantitative understanding of their relationships and statistical properties. In particular, we lack a framework that reproduces the empirical statistical properties of beta-diversity metrics. Here we take a macroecological approach and introduce a model to reproduce the statistical properties of community similarity. The model is based on the statistical properties of individual communities and on a single tunable parameter, the correlation of species’ carrying capacities across communities, which sets the difference of two communities. The model reproduces quantitatively the empirical values of several commonly-used beta-diversity metrics, as well as the relationships between them. In particular, this modeling framework naturally reproduces the negative correlation between overlap and dissimilarity, which has been observed in both empirical and experimental communities and previously related to the existence of universal features of community dynamics. In this framework, such correlation naturally emerges due to the effect of random sampling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the interaction between stem cells derived cardiomyocytes patches and host myocardium to aid non-arrhythmic engineered heart tissue design</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Damiano Fassina, Caroline M. Costa, Stefano Longobardi, Elias Karabelas, Gernot Plank, Sian E. Harding, Steven A. Niederer</p>

Application of epicardial patches constructed from human-induced pluripotent stem cell- derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) has been proposed as a long-term therapy to treat scarred hearts post myocardial infarction (MI). Understanding electrical interaction between engineered heart tissue patches (EHT) and host myocardium represents a key step toward a successful patch engraftment. EHT retain different electrical properties with respect to the host heart tissue due to the hiPSC-CMs immature phenotype, which may lead to increased arrhythmia risk. We developed a modelling framework to examine the influence of patch design on electrical activation at the engraftment site. We performed an in-silico investigation of different patch design approaches to restore pre-MI activation properties and evaluated the associated arrhythmic risk. We developed an <i>in silico</i> cardiac electrophysiology model of a transmural cross section of host myocardium. The model featured an infarct region, an epicardial patch spanning the infarct region and a bath region. The patch is modelled as a layer of hiPSC-CM, combined with a layer of conductive polymer (CP). Tissue and patch geometrical dimensions and conductivities were incorporated through 10 modifiable model parameters. We validated our model against 4 independent experimental studies and showed that it can qualitatively reproduce their findings. We performed a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to isolate the most important parameters, showing that the stimulus propagation is mainly governed by the scar depth, radius and conductivity when the scar is not transmural, and by the EHT patch conductivity when the scar is transmural. We assessed the relevance of small animal studies to humans by comparing simulations of rat, rabbit and human myocardium. We found that stimulus propagation paths and GSA sensitivity indices are consistent across species. We explored which EHT design variables have the potential to restore physiological propagation. Simulations predict that increasing EHT conductivity from 0.28 to 1–1.1 S/m recovered physiological activation in rat, rabbit and human. Finally, we assessed arrhythmia risk related to increasing EHT conductivity and tested increasing the EHT Na<sup>+</sup> channel density as an alternative strategy to match healthy activation. Our results revealed a greater arrhythmia risk linked to increased EHT conductivity compared to increased Na<sup>+</sup> channel density. We demonstrated that our modeling framework could capture the interaction between host and EHT patches observed in <i>in vitro</i> experiments. We showed that large (patch and tissue dimensions) and small (cardiac myocyte electrophysiology) scale differences between small animals and humans do not alter EHT patch effect on infarcted tissue. Our model revealed that only when the scar is transmural do EHT properties impact activation times and isolated the EHT conductivity as the main parameter influencing propagation. We predicted that restoring physiological activation by tuning EHT conductivity is possible but may promote arrhythmic behavior. Finally, our model suggests that acting on hiPSC-CMs low action potential upstroke velocity and lack of I<sub>K1</sub> may restore pre-MI activation while not promoting arrhythmia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Non-linear archetypal analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data by deep autoencoders</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuge Wang, Hongyu Zhao</p>

Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have led to successes in discovering novel cell types and understanding cellular heterogeneity among complex cell populations through cluster analysis. However, cluster analysis is not able to reveal continuous spectrum of states and underlying gene expression programs (GEPs) shared across cell types. We introduce scAAnet, an autoencoder for single-cell non-linear archetypal analysis, to identify GEPs and infer the relative activity of each GEP across cells. We use a count distribution-based loss term to account for the sparsity and overdispersion of the raw count data and add an archetypal constraint to the loss function of scAAnet. We first show that scAAnet outperforms existing methods for archetypal analysis across different metrics through simulations. We then demonstrate the ability of scAAnet to extract biologically meaningful GEPs using publicly available scRNA-seq datasets including a pancreatic islet dataset, a lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis dataset and a prefrontal cortex dataset.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Short-term and long-term epidemiological impacts of sustained vector control in various dengue endemic settings: A modelling study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Haoyang Sun, Joel Koo, Borame L. Dickens, Hannah E. Clapham, Alex R. Cook</p>

As the most widespread viral infection transmitted by the <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes, dengue has been estimated to cause 51 million febrile disease cases globally each year. Although sustained vector control remains key to reducing the burden of dengue, current understanding of the key factors that explain the observed variation in the short- and long-term vector control effectiveness across different transmission settings remains limited. We used a detailed individual-based model to simulate dengue transmission with and without sustained vector control over a 30-year time frame, under different transmission scenarios. Vector control effectiveness was derived for different time windows within the 30-year intervention period. We then used the extreme gradient boosting algorithm to predict the effectiveness of vector control given the simulation parameters, and the resulting machine learning model was interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations. According to our simulation outputs, dengue transmission would be nearly eliminated during the early stage of sustained and intensive vector control, but over time incidence would gradually bounce back to the pre-intervention level unless the intervention is implemented at a very high level of intensity. The time point at which intervention ceases to be effective is strongly influenced not only by the intensity of vector control, but also by the pre-intervention transmission intensity and the individual-level heterogeneity in biting risk. Moreover, the impact of many transmission model parameters on the intervention effectiveness is shown to be modified by the intensity of vector control, as well as to vary over time. Our study has identified some of the critical drivers for the difference in the time-varying effectiveness of sustained vector control across different dengue endemic settings, and the insights obtained will be useful to inform future model-based studies that seek to predict the impact of dengue vector control in their local contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Packaging contests between viral RNA molecules and kinetic selectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Inbal Mizrahi, Robijn Bruinsma, Joseph Rudnick</p>

The paper presents a statistical-mechanics model for the kinetic selection of viral RNA molecules by packaging signals during the nucleation stage of the assembly of small RNA viruses. The effects of the RNA secondary structure and folding geometry of the packaging signals on the assembly activation energy barrier are encoded by a pair of characteristics: the <i>wrapping number</i> and the <i>maximum ladder distance</i>. Kinetic selection is found to be optimal when assembly takes place under conditions of <i>supersaturation</i> and also when the concentration ratio of capsid protein and viral RNA concentrations equals the stoichiometric ratio of assembled viral particles. As a function of the height of the activation energy barrier, there is a form of order-disorder transition such that for sufficiently low activation energy barriers, kinetic selectivity is erased by entropic effects associated with the number of assembly pathways.

<p><i>Bate palmas</i> (<i>bapa</i>) mutant mice were validated as a model of Kabuki syndrome as they were more susceptible to infections. Juvenile <i>bapa</i> mice also presented dopaminergic system hyperactivity. Juvenile control and <i>bapa</i> female mice emitted a novel vocalization pattern: 31-kHz.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The recessive mutant mouse <i>bate palmas</i> (<i>bapa</i>) arose from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Previous studies of our group revealed some behavioral impairments and a mutation in the lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (Kmt2d) gene. Because mutations in the KMT2D gene in humans are mainly responsible for Kabuki syndrome, this study was proposed to validate <i>bapa</i> mice as a model of Kabuki syndrome. Besides other symptoms, Kabuki syndrome is characterized by increased susceptibility to infections and speech impairments, usually diagnosed in the early childhood. Thus, juvenile male and female <i>bapa</i> mice were studied in different developmental stages (prepubertal period and puberty). To induce sickness behavior and to study infection susceptibility responses, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used. To study oral communication, ultrasonic vocalizations were evaluated. Behavioral (open-field test) and central (astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and tyrosine hydroxylase [TH]) evaluations were also performed. Control and <i>bapa</i> female mice emitted 31-kHz ultrasounds on prepubertal period when exploring a novel environment, a frequency not yet described for mice, being defined as 31-kHz exploratory vocalizations. Males, LPS, and puberty inhibited these vocalizations. <i>Bapa</i> mice presented increased motor/exploratory behaviors on prepubertal period due to increased striatal TH expression, revealing striatal dopaminergic system hyperactivity. Combining open-field behavior and GFAP expression, <i>bapa</i> mice did not develop LPS tolerance, that is, they remained expressing signs of sickness behavior after LPS challenge, being more susceptible to infectious/inflammatory processes. It was concluded that <i>bapa</i> mice is a robust experimental model of Kabuki syndrome.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the development of cellular and humoral immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with MS aged 18 to 60 years were evaluated for anti-nucleocapsid and anti-Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody with electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay; antibody responses to Spike protein, RBD, N-terminal domain with multiepitope bead-based immunoassays (MBI); live virus immunofluorescence-based microneutralization assay; T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike using TruCulture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and IL-2 and IFNγ ELISpot assays. Assay results were compared by DMT class. Spearman correlation and multivariate analyses were performed to examine associations between immunologic responses and infection severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between January 6, 2021, and July 21, 2021, 389 patients with MS were recruited (mean age 40.3 years; 74% women; 62% non-White). Most common DMTs were ocrelizumab (OCR)—40%; natalizumab —17%, Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulators −12%; and 15% untreated. One hundred seventy-seven patients (46%) had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 130 had symptomatic infection, and 47 were asymptomatic. Antibody responses were markedly attenuated in OCR compared with other groups (<i>p</i> ≤0.0001). T-cell responses (IFNγ) were decreased in S1P (<i>p</i> = 0.03), increased in natalizumab (<i>p</i> &lt;0.001), and similar in other DMTs, including OCR. Cellular and humoral responses were moderately correlated in both OCR (<i>r</i> = 0.45, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and non-OCR (<i>r</i> = 0.64, <i>p</i> &lt;0.0001). Immune responses did not differ by race/ethnicity. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical course was mostly non-severe and similar across DMTs; 7% (9/130) were hospitalized.</p>

                A recent study by Triphati et al. used a protein engineering approach to demonstrate that cellular stress caused by familial α-synuclein mutations can be alleviated by altering the monounsaturated fatty acid equilibrium in neuronal cells. This work supports the notion that metabolic perturbation of lipids may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An incentive circuit for memory dynamics in the mushroom body of Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Insects adapt their response to stimuli, such as odours, according to their pairing with positive or negative reinforcements, such as sugar or shock. Recent electrophysiological and imaging findings in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> allow detailed examination of the neural mechanisms supporting the acquisition, forgetting, and assimilation of memories. We propose that this data can be explained by the combination of a dopaminergic plasticity rule that supports a variety of synaptic strength change phenomena, and a circuit structure (derived from neuroanatomy) between dopaminergic and output neurons that creates different roles for specific neurons. Computational modelling shows that this circuit allows for rapid memory acquisition, transfer from short term to long term, and exploration/exploitation trade-off. The model can reproduce the observed changes in the activity of each of the identified neurons in conditioning paradigms and can be used for flexible behavioural control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Synthetic reconstruction of the hunchback promoter specifies the role of Bicoid, Zelda and Hunchback in the dynamics of its transcription</a></h4>

              
                For over 40 years, the Bicoid-<i>hunchback</i> (Bcd-<i>hb</i>) system in the fruit fly embryo has been used as a model to study how positional information in morphogen concentration gradients is robustly translated into step-like responses. A body of quantitative comparisons between theory and experiment have since questioned the initial paradigm that the sharp <i>hb</i> transcription pattern emerges solely from diffusive biochemical interactions between the Bicoid transcription factor and the gene promoter region. Several alternative mechanisms have been proposed, such as additional sources of positional information, positive feedback from Hb proteins or out-of-equilibrium transcription activation. By using the MS2-MCP RNA-tagging system and analysing in real time, the transcription dynamics of synthetic reporters for Bicoid and/or its two partners Zelda and Hunchback, we show that all the early <i>hb</i> expression pattern features and temporal dynamics are compatible with an equilibrium model with a short decay length Bicoid activity gradient as a sole source of positional information. Meanwhile, Bicoid’s partners speed-up the process by different means: Zelda lowers the Bicoid concentration threshold required for transcriptional activation while Hunchback reduces burstiness and increases the polymerase firing rate.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An auxin-inducible, GAL4-compatible, gene expression system for Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The ability to control transgene expression, both spatially and temporally, is essential for studying model organisms. In <i>Drosophila</i>, spatial control is primarily provided by the GAL4/UAS system, whilst temporal control relies on a temperature-sensitive GAL80 (which inhibits GAL4) and drug-inducible systems. However, these are not ideal. Shifting temperature can impact on many physiological and behavioural traits, and the current drug-inducible systems are either leaky, toxic, incompatible with existing GAL4-driver lines, or do not generate effective levels of expression. Here, we describe the auxin-inducible gene expression system (AGES). AGES relies on the auxin-dependent degradation of a ubiquitously expressed GAL80, and therefore, is compatible with existing GAL4-driver lines. Water-soluble auxin is added to fly food at a low, non-lethal, concentration, which induces expression comparable to uninhibited GAL4 expression. The system works in both larvae and adults, providing a stringent, non-lethal, cost-effective, and convenient method for temporally controlling GAL4 activity in <i>Drosophila</i>.

                Dynamics of excitable cells and networks depend on the membrane time constant, set by membrane resistance and capacitance. Whereas pharmacological and genetic manipulations of ionic conductances of excitable membranes are routine in electrophysiology, experimental control over capacitance remains a challenge. Here, we present capacitance clamp, an approach that allows electrophysiologists to mimic a modified capacitance in biological neurons via an unconventional application of the dynamic clamp technique. We first demonstrate the feasibility to quantitatively modulate capacitance in a mathematical neuron model and then confirm the functionality of capacitance clamp in in vitro experiments in granule cells of rodent dentate gyrus with up to threefold virtual capacitance changes. Clamping of capacitance thus constitutes a novel technique to probe and decipher mechanisms of neuronal signaling in ways that were so far inaccessible to experimental electrophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiopathological changes of ferritin mRNA density and distribution in hippocampal astrocytes in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are thought to play a crucial role in brain iron homeostasis. How they accomplish this regulation in vivo remains unclear. In a recent transcriptomic analysis, we showed that polysomal Ftl1 and Fth1 mRNAs, encoding the ferritin light (Ftl) and heavy (Fth) chains that assemble into ferritin, a critical complex for iron storage and reduction, are enriched in perisynaptic astrocytic processes as compared to astrocytic soma. These data suggested that ferritin translation plays a specific role at the perisynaptic astrocytic interface and is tighly regulated by local translation. Here, we used our recently described AstroDot 3D in situ methodology to study the density and localization of ferritin mRNAs in astrocytes in the hippocampus in three different contexts in which local or systemic iron overload has been documented: ageing, the hepcidin knock-out mouse model of hemochromatosis and the APP/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimers disease (AD). Our results showed that in wild type mice, Fth1 mRNA density was higher than Ftl1 and that both mRNAs were mostly distributed in astrocyte fine processes. Ageing and absence of hepcidin caused an increased Fth1/Ftl1 ratio in astrocytes and in the case of ageing, led to a redistribution of Fth1 mRNAs in astrocytic fine processes. In contrast, in AD mice, we observed a lower Fth1/Ftl1 ratio and Fth1 mRNAs became more somatic. Hence, we propose that regulation of ferritin mRNA density and distribution in astrocytes regulates iron homeostasis in physiology and pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Irrational choices via a curvilinear representational geometry for value</a></h4>

              
                We make decisions by comparing values, but how is value represented in the brain? Many models assume, if only implicitly, that the representational geometry of value is linear. However, in part due to a historical focus on noisy single neurons, rather than neuronal populations, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Here, we examined the representational geometry of value in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a part of the brain linked to economic decision-making. We found that values were encoded along a curved manifold in vmPFC. This curvilinear geometry predicted a specific pattern of irrational decision-making: that decision-makers will make worse choices when an irrelevant, decoy option is worse in value, compared to when it is better. Indeed, we observed these irrational choices in behavior. Together, these results not only suggest that the representational geometry of value is nonlinear, but that this nonlinearity could impose bounds on rational decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different olfactory neuron classes use distinct temporal and molecular programs to complete synaptic development</a></h4>

              
                Developing neurons must meet core molecular, cellular, and temporal requirements to ensure the correct formation of synapses, resulting in functional circuits. However, because of the vast diversity in neuronal class and function, it is unclear whether or not all neurons use the same organizational mechanisms to form synaptic connections and achieve functional and morphological maturation. Moreover, it remains unknown if neurons united in a common goal and comprising the same sensory circuit develop on similar timescales and using identical molecular approaches to ensure the formation of the correct number of synapses. To begin to answer these questions, we took advantage of the Drosophila antennal lobe, a model olfactory circuit with remarkable genetic access and synapse-level resolution. Using tissue-specific genetic labeling of active zones, we performed a quantitative analysis of synapse formation in multiple classes of neurons throughout development and adulthood. We found that olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons (LNs) each have unique time-courses of synaptic development, addition, and refinement, demonstrating that each class follows a distinct developmental program. This raised the possibility that these classes may also have distinct molecular requirements for synapse formation. We genetically altered neuronal activity in each neuronal subtype and observed differing effects on synapse number based on the neuronal class examined. Silencing neuronal activity in ORNs, PNs, and LNs impaired synaptic development but only in ORNs did enhancing neuronal activity influence synapse formation. ORNs and LNs demonstrated similar impairment of synaptic development with enhanced activity of a master kinase, GSK-3{beta}, suggesting that neuronal activity and GSK-3{beta} kinase activity function in a common pathway. ORNs also, however, demonstrated impaired synaptic development with GSK-3{beta} loss-of-function, suggesting additional activity-independent roles in development. Ultimately, our results suggest that the requirements for synaptic development are not uniform across all neuronal classes with considerable diversity existing in both their developmental timeframes and molecular requirements. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of synaptic development and lay the foundation for future work determining their underlying etiologies.

                The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the main interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex. The EC plays a critical role in learning and memory. We investigated the neuronal representation of behavioral events during operant learning in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit of head-fixed rats. Both CA1 and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) neurons develop task-related activities after learning. Among diverse task-related activities, we compared the transient peak activities that represent action and reward and found a distinct difference in the timing of behavioral event representation between CA1 and LEC. CA1 represents action and reward events in close to real-time, whereas both the superficial and deep layers of the LEC showed delayed representation of those events. Our results suggest that subpopulations exist within which CA1 and LEC neurons process the information in a different order from the anatomically defined hippocampal-entorhinal circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">History of previous midlife estradiol treatment permanently alters interactions of brain insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling and hippocampal estrogen synthesis to enhance cognitive aging in a rat model of menopause</a></h4>

              
                Across species, including humans, elevated levels of brain estrogen receptor (ER)  are associated with enhanced cognitive aging even in the absence of circulating estrogens. In rodents, short-term estrogen treatment--such as that commonly used in the menopausal transition--results in long-term increases in levels of ER in the hippocampus, leading to enhanced memory long after termination of estrogen treatment. However, mechanisms by which increased levels of brain ER enhances cognitive aging remain unclear. Here we show that in the hippocampus, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)--which can activate ER via ligand-independent mechanisms--requires concomitant synthesis of brain-derived neuroestrogens to phosphorylate ER via MAPK signaling, ultimately resulting in enhanced memory. In a rat model of menopause involving long-term ovarian hormone deprivation, hippocampal neuroestrogen activity decreases, altering IGF-1 activity and resulting in impaired memory. However, this process is reversed by short-term estradiol treatment. Forty-days of estradiol exposure following ovariectomy results in maintenance of neuroestrogen levels that persist beyond the period of hormone treatment, allowing for continued interactions between IGF-1 and neuroestrogen signaling, elevated levels of hippocampal ER, and ultimately enhanced memory. Collectively, results demonstrate that short-term estradiol use following loss of ovarian function has long-lasting effects on hippocampal function and memory by dynamically regulating cellular mechanisms that promote activity of ER in the absence of circulating estrogens. Translational impacts of these findings suggest lasting cognitive benefits of short-term estrogen use near menopause and highlight the importance of hippocampal ER, independent from the role of circulating estrogens,in regulating memory in aging females.

                Noisy social environments constrain human speech intelligibility in two primary ways: spectro-temporal overlap between signals and noise reduces speech audibility (energetic masking) and noise interferes with processing the informative features of otherwise audible speech (informational masking). To date, informational masking has not been investigated in studies of vocal communication in nonhuman animals, even though their behavioral decisions frequently depend on extracting information from vocalizations in noisy aggregations. In this study of a treefrog, in which females chose mates in noisy breeding choruses, we investigated whether informational masking can disrupt the processing of signal information in the contexts of species recognition and sexual selection. We observed significant reductions in response to the vocalizations of a potential mate when they were broadcast concurrently with other biologically relevant sounds designed to reduce or eliminate energetic masking. These effects were more pronounced when competing sounds were present in a particularly salient frequency range for processing vocalizations. Among responsive subjects, however, performance in signal recognition and discrimination tasks remained largely unchanged. These results confirm that informational masking is a general communication problem among humans and other animals and suggest it may be a crucial yet understudied source of selection shaping the evolution of animal communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The mouse claustrum synaptically connects cortical network motifs</a></h4>

              
                Spatially distant areas of cerebral cortex coordinate their activity into networks that are integral to cognitive processing. A common structural motif of cortical networks is co-activated frontal and posterior cortical regions. Knowledge of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying such widespread inter-areal cortical coordination is lacking. Using anesthetized mouse functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we discovered that mouse frontal cortical functional connectivity reflects the common cortical network motif in its functional connectivity to posterior cortices, but also demonstrates significant functional connectivity with the claustrum. Exploring whether the claustrum may synaptically support such network architecture, we used a channelrhodopsin-assisted electrophysiological circuit mapping approach to assess the strength of synaptic connectivity of 35 unique frontal cortico-claustral-cortical connections through 1,050 subtype-identified claustrum projection neurons. We observed significant trans-claustral synaptic connectivity from the anterior cingulate cortex and prelimbic prefrontal cortex back to originating frontal cortical regions as well as to posteriorly-lying visual and parietal association cortices contralaterally. The infralimbic prefrontal cortex possessed significant trans-claustral synaptic connectivity with the posteriorly-lying retrosplenial cortex, but to a far lesser degree with visual and parietal association cortices. These data reveal discrete extended cortical pathways through the claustrum that are positioned to support cortical network motifs central to cognitive control functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Munc13 supports vesicle fusogenicity after disrupting active zone scaffolds and synaptic vesicle docking</a></h4>

              
                Active zones consist of protein scaffolds that are tightly attached to the presynaptic plasma membrane. They dock and prime synaptic vesicles, couple them to Ca2+ entry, and target neurotransmitter release to postsynaptic receptor domains. Simultaneous RIM+ELKS ablation disrupts these scaffolds, abolishes vesicle docking and removes active zone-targeted Munc13, but some vesicles remain releasable. This enduring vesicular fusogenicity may be Munc13-independent or be mediated by non-active zone-anchored Munc13. We tested its Munc13-dependence by ablating Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 on top of RIM+ELKS in cultured hippocampal neurons. The hextuple knockout synapses lacked docked vesicles, but other ultrastructural features were near-normal despite the strong genetic manipulation. Removing Munc13 in addition to RIM+ELKS further impaired action potential-evoked release by decreasing the remaining pool of releasable vesicles. We conclude that Munc13 can support some fusogenicity without RIM and ELKS, and that presynaptic recruitment of Munc13, even without active zone-anchoring, suffices to generate some fusion-competent vesicles.

                How humans transform sensory information into decisions that steer purposeful behaviour is a central question in psychology and neuroscience that is traditionally investigated during the sampling of external sensations. The decision-making framework of gradual information sampling toward a decision has been proposed also to apply when sampling internal sensory evidence from memory. However, neural evidence for this proposal remains lacking. Here we report that sampling internal visual representations from working memory elicits a scalp-EEG potential associated with gradual evidence accumulation - the Central Parietal Positivity (CPP). Consistent with an evolving decision process, we show how this signal (i) builds up to, and scales with, the time participants require to reach a decision about the cued memory content and (ii) is amplified when having to select (decide) among multiple contents in working memory. These results bring the electrophysiology of decision making into the domain of working memory and suggest that variability in memory-guided behaviour may be driven (at least in part) by variations in the sampling of our inner mental contents.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Mutations, gene dosage increase, and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the -synuclein-encoding gene SNCA either cause or increase the risk for PD. However, neither the function of -synuclein in health and disease, nor its role throughout development is fully understood. Here, we introduce DeePhys, a new tool that allows for data-driven functional phenotyping of neuronal cell lines by combining electrophysiological features inferred from high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) recordings with a robust machine learning workflow. We apply DeePhys to human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived DA neuron-astrocyte co-cultures harboring the prominent SNCA mutation A53T and an isogenic control line. Moreover, we demonstrate how DeePhys can facilitate the assessment of cellular and network-level electrophysiological features to build functional phenotypes and to evaluate potential treatment interventions. We find that electrophysiological features across all scales proved to be highly specific for the A53T phenotype, enabled to predict the genotype and age of individual cultures with high accuracy, and revealed a mutant-like phenotype after downregulation of -synuclein.

                Mutations enhancing the kinase activity of LRRK2 cause Parkinson's disease (PD) and therapies that reduce LRRK2 kinase activity are being tested in clinical trials. Numerous rare variants of unknown clinical significance have been reported, but how the vast majority impact on LRRK2 function is unknown. Here, we investigate 98 LRRK2 variants linked to PD, including previously described pathogenic mutations, and identify 22 variants that robustly stimulate LRRK2 kinase activity. These include variants within the N-terminal non-catalytic regions [ARM (E334K, A419V), ANK (R767H), LRR (R1067Q, R1325Q)] as well as variants residing within the GTPase domain, predicted to destabilise the ROC:CORB interface [ROC (A1442P, V1447M), CORB (S1761R, L1795F)] and CORB:CORB dimer interface [CORB (R1728H/L)]. Most activating variants decrease LRRK2 biomarker site phosphorylation (pSer910/pSer935), consistent with the notion that the active kinase conformation blocks their phosphorylation. We find that the R1628P variant that has been linked to PD does not stimulate LRRK2 activity. We observe that the impact of variants on kinase activity is best evaluated by deploying a cellular assay of LRRK2-dependent Rab10 substrate phosphorylation at Thr73 compared to an in vitro kinase assay, as only a minority of activating variants enhance the activity of immunoprecipitated LRRK2, comprising the CORB (Y1699C, R1728H, S1761R) and kinase (G2019S, I2020T, T2031S) variants. Twelve variants including some that activated LRRK2, suppressed microtubule association in the presence of a Type 1 kinase inhibitor [ARM (M712V), LRR (R1320S), ROC (A1442P, K1468E, S1508R), CORA (A1589S), CORB (Y1699C, R1728H/L) and WD40 (R2143M, S2350I, G2385R)]. Our findings will aid in understanding the impact of these variants on LRRK2 kinase activation, stimulate work to reveal mechanisms by which variants impact biology, and provide rationale for variant carrier inclusion or exclusion in ongoing and future LRRK2 clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-range inhibition synchronizes and updates prefrontal task activity</a></h4>

              
                Changes in patterns of activity within the medial prefrontal cortex enable rodents, non-human primates, and humans to update their behavior to adapt to changes in the environment, e.g., during cognitive tasks. Within medial prefrontal cortex, inhibitory neurons expressing parvalbumin are important for updating strategies in a rule shift task. Nevertheless, causal mechanisms through which parvalbumin neurons recruit specific circuits to produce prefrontal network dynamics that switch from maintaining to updating task-related patterns of activity remain unknown. Here we identify a new long-range inhibitory projection from prefrontal parvalbumin neurons to the contralateral cortex that mediates this process. Whereas nonspecifically inhibiting all callosal projections does not prevent mice from learning rule shifts, selectively inhibiting these callosal parvalbumin projections disrupts rule shift learning, desynchronizes gamma-frequency activity that is necessary for learning, and suppresses changes in prefrontal activity patterns that normally accompany rule shifts. Thus, callosal parvalbumin projections switch prefrontal circuits from maintaining to updating behavioral strategies by synchronizing callosal communication and preventing it from inappropriately maintaining outdated neural representations. These findings may explain how deficits in prefrontal parvalbumin neurons and gamma synchrony cause impaired behavioral flexibility in schizophrenia, and identify long-range projections from prefrontal parvalbumin neurons as a key circuit locus for understanding and treating these deficits.

                Work in the last two decades has identified sleep spindles, discrete 'sigma band' oscillations during stage 2 sleep, as a key oscillatory mechanism required for off-line memory consolidation. Although, sleep spindles are known to evolve concomitant with brain maturation and reflect cognitive function across the lifespan, the details of this developmental trajectory are unknown. To address this, we curated a database of sleep electroencephalograms from 772 developmentally normal children to characterize spindles from birth through 18 years. After validating an automated spindle detector against ~20,000 hand-marked spindles across ages, we demonstrate that sleep spindle features follow distinct age-specific patterns in distribution, rate, duration, frequency, estimated refractory period, and inter-hemispheric spindle lag. These data expand our current knowledge of normal physiological brain development and provide a large normative database to detect deviations in sleep spindles to aid discovery, biomarker development, and diagnosis in pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often described as promising models of human vision, yet they show many differences from human abilities. We focus on a superhuman capacity of top-performing CNNs, namely, their ability to learn very large datasets of random patterns. We verify that human learning on such tasks is extremely limited, even with few stimuli. We argue that the performance difference is due to CNNs' overcapacity and introduce biologically inspired mechanisms to constrain it, while retaining the good test set generalisation to structured images as characteristic of CNNs. We investigate the efficacy of adding noise to hidden units' activations, restricting early convolutional layers with an information bottleneck, and using a bounded activation function. Internal noise was the most potent intervention and the only one which, by itself, could reduce random data performance in the tested models to chance levels. We also investigated whether networks with biologically inspired capacity constraints show improved generalisation to out-of-distribution stimuli, however little benefit was observed. Our results suggest that constraining networks with biologically motivated mechanisms paves the way for closer correspondence between network and human performance, but the few manipulations we have tested are only a small step towards that goal.

                When judging the average value of sample stimuli (e.g., numbers) people tend to either over- or underweight extreme sample values, depending on task context. In a context of overweighting, recent work has shown that extreme sample values were overly represented also in neural signals, in terms of an anti-compressed geometry of number samples in multivariate electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. Here, we asked whether neural representational geometries may also reflect underweighting of extreme values (i.e., compression) which has been observed behaviorally in a great variety of tasks. We used a simple experimental manipulation (instructions to average a single-stream or to compare dual-streams of samples) to induce compression or anti-compression in behavior when participants judged rapid number sequences. Model-based representational similarity analysis (RSA) replicated the previous finding of neural anti-compression in the dual-stream task, but failed to provide evidence for neural compression in the single-stream task, despite the evidence for compression in behavior. Instead, the results suggested enhanced neural processing of extreme values in either task, regardless of whether extremes were over- or underweighted in subsequent behavioral choice. We further observed more general differences in the neural representation of the sample information between the two tasks. The results suggest enhanced processing of extreme values as the brain's default. Such a default raises new questions about the origin of common psychometric distortions, such as diminishing sensitivity for larger values.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Performance comparison of systemic activity correction in fNIRS for methods with and without short distance channels</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising tool for neurofeedback (NFB) or brain computer interfaces (BCIs). However, fNIRS signals are typically highly contaminated by systemic activity (SA) artifacts and, if not properly corrected, NFB or BCIs run the risk of being based on noise instead of brain activity. This risk can likely be reduced by correcting for SA, in particular when short distance channels (SDCs) are available. Literature comparing correction methods with and without SDCs is still sparse, specifically comparisons considering single trials are lacking. Aim: This study aimed at comparing the performance of SA correction methods with and without SDCs. Approach: Semi-simulated and real motor task data of healthy elderly individuals were used. Correction methods without SDCs included a simple and a more advanced spatial filter. Correction methods with SDCs included a regression approach considering only the closest SDC and two GLM-based methods, one including all eight SDCs and one using only two a priori selected SDCs as regressors. All methods were compared to data uncorrected for SA and correction performance was assessed with quality measures quantifying signal improvement and spatial specificity at single trial level. Results: All correction methods were found to improve signal quality and to enhance spatial specificity as compared to the uncorrected data. Methods with SDCs usually outperformed methods without SDCs. Correction methods without SDCs tended to overcorrect the data. However, the exact pattern of results and the degree of differences observable between correction methods varied between semi-simulated and real data, and also between quality measures. Conclusions: Overall, results confirmed that both {Delta}[HbO] and {Delta}[HbR] are affected by SA and that correction methods with SDCs outperform methods without SDCs. Nonetheless, improvements in signal quality can also be achieved without SDCs and should therefore be given priority over not correcting for SA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unraveling the functional attributes of the language connectome: crucial subnetworks, flexibility and variability.</a></h4>

              
                Language processing is a highly integrative function, intertwining linguistic operations (processing the language code intentionally used for communication) and extra-linguistic processes (e.g., attention monitoring, predictive inference, long-term memory). This synergetic cognitive architecture requires a distributed and specialized neural substrate. Brain systems have mostly been examined at rest. However, task-related functional connectivity provides additional and valuable information about how information is processed when various cognitive states are involved. We gathered thirteen language fMRI tasks in a unique database of one hundred and fifty neurotypical adults (InLang database). The tasks were designed to assess a wide range of linguistic processes and subprocesses. From this database, we applied network theory as a computational tool to model the task-related functional connectome of language (LANG). The organization of this data-driven neurocognitive atlas of language is examined at multiple levels, uncovering its major components (or crucial subnetworks) and its anatomical and functional correlates. Furthermore, we estimate its reconfiguration as a function of linguistic demand (flexibility), or several factors such as age or gender (variability). By accounting for the multifaceted nature of language and modulating factors, this study can contribute to enrich and refine existing neurocognitive models of language. The LANG atlas can also be considered as a reference for comparative or clinical studies, involving a variety of patients and conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Affective enhancement of episodic memory is associated with widespread patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Subjectively arousing experiences tend to be better remembered than neutral ones. While numerous task-related neuroimaging studies have revealed the neural mechanisms associated with this phenomenon, it remains unclear how variability in the extent to which individuals show superior memory for subjectively arousing stimuli is associated with the intrinsic functional organization of their brains. Here, we addressed this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected at rest from a sample drawn from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing Neuroscience cohort (N = 269, 18-86 years). Specifically, we performed multi-voxel pattern analysis of intrinsic functional connectivity, an unbiased, data-driven approach to examine whole-brain voxel-wise connectivity patterns. This technique allowed us to reveal the most important features from the high-dimensional, whole-brain connectivity structure without a priori hypotheses about the topography and direction of functional connectivity differences. Behaviorally, both item and associative memory accuracy were enhanced for trials with affectively arousing (positive or negative) stimuli than those with neutral ones. Whole-brain multi-voxel pattern analysis of functional connectivity revealed that the affective enhancement of memory was associated with intrinsic connectivity patterns of spatially distributed brain regions belonging to several functional networks in the cerebral cortex. Post hoc seed-based brain-behavior regression analysis and principal component analysis of the resulting correlation maps showed that these connectivity patterns were in turn primarily characterized by the involvement of heteromodal association (dorsal attention, salience, and default mode) networks as well as select subcortical structures (striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum). Collectively, these findings suggest that the affective enhancement of episodic memory may be characterized as a whole-brain phenomenon, possibly supported by intrinsic functional interactions across several networks and structures in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Frontal Cortex Gates Distractor Stimulus Encoding in Target Sensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Suppressing behavioral responses to distractor stimuli is a fundamental cognitive process, essential for performing goal-directed tasks. A common framework for the neuronal implementation of distractor suppression is the attenuation of distractor stimuli from early sensory to higher-order processing. However, details of the localization and mechanisms of attenuation are poorly understood. In this study, we trained mice to selectively respond (lick) to whisker deflections from one whisker field and ignore identical deflections from the opposite whisker field. We found that suppression of frontal cortex, aligned to the target stimulus or the distractor stimulus, increases responses to distractors (false alarms). By simultaneously recording spiking activity in the mouse whisker region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we found that frontal cortex selectively suppresses the neuronal encoding of distractor stimuli in target-aligned S1. Frontal cortex decorrelates the encoding of target and distractor stimuli in single units, thereby increasing stimulus selectivity across the population of target-aligned S1 neurons. Even before stimulus onset, effects of frontal cortex on S1 were robust and context-dependent, indicating proactive modulation. Overall, our study provides important mechanistic details about the roles of frontal cortex in gating sensory responses in sensory cortex.

                Negative family environment can be harmful for a child's psychological wellbeing through suboptimal child-parent interactions. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in socioemotional cognition within either child or parent's brain, but how interactions between child and parent brains within this region contribute to children's psychological wellbeing remain unknown. Across two studies examining 395 child-parent dyads, results showed that children from negative family environment experienced more psychopathological symptoms. Dyad-based analyses of movie-watching functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed that children had higher inter-subject correlations in dorsal- and ventral-mPFC with parents than stranger controls, and increased concordance of activity with regions critical for socioemotional skills. Negative family environment reduced inter-subject connectivity of the ventral-MPFC with the hippocampus in child-parent dyads, which further mediated children's internalizing symptoms. The ventral-mPFC and hippocampus exhibited reciprocal activity concordance in child-parent dyads. Our findings suggest child-parent brain-to-brain concordance as a neurobiological mechanism of how family environment affects psychopathological symptoms.

                The majority of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes are associated with ASD due to haploinsufficiency, where only one gene copy is functional. Here, using SCN2A haploinsufficiency, a major risk factor for ASD, we show that increasing the expression of the existing functional SCN2A allele with CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) can provide a viable therapeutic approach. We first demonstrate therapeutic potential by showing that restoring Scn2a expression in adolescent heterozygous Scn2a conditional knock-in mice rescues electrophysiological deficits associated with Scn2a haploinsufficiency. Next, using an rAAV-CRISPRa based treatment, we restore electrophysiological deficits in both Scn2a heterozygous mice and human stem-cell-derived neurons. Our results provide a novel therapeutic approach for numerous ASD-associated genes and demonstrate that rescue of Scn2a haploinsufficiency, even at adolescent stages, can ameliorate neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Responses of cortical neurons to intracortical microstimulation in awake primates</a></h4>

              
                Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is commonly used in many experimental and clinical paradigms; however, its effects on the activation of neurons are still not completely understood. To document the responses of cortical neurons in non-human primates to stimulation, we recorded single unit activity while delivering single-pulse stimulation via Utah arrays implanted in primary motor cortex of three macaque monkeys. Stimuli between 5-50 A delivered to single channels reliably evoked spikes in neurons recorded throughout the array with delays of up to 12 milliseconds. ICMS pulses also induced a period of inhibition lasting up to 150 ms that typically followed the initial excitatory response. Higher current amplitudes led to a greater probability of evoking a spike and extended the duration of inhibition. The likelihood of evoking a spike in a neuron was dependent on the spontaneous firing rate as well as the delay between its most recent spike time and stimulus onset. Repetitive stimulation often modulated both the probability of evoking spikes and the duration of inhibition, although high frequency stimulation in particular was more likely to change both responses. Comparisons between stimuli that evoked a spike and stimuli that did not revealed that the excitatory and inhibitory responses were independent of one another on a trial-by-trial basis; however, their changes over time were frequently positively or negatively correlated. Our results document the complex dynamics of cortical neural responses to electrical stimulation that need to be considered when utilizing ICMS for scientific and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Retinal ganglion cell endowment is correlated with optic tract fiber cross section, not density</a></h4>

              
                There is substantial variation between healthy individuals in the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in the eye, with commensurate variation in the number of axons in the optic tracts. Fixel-based analysis of diffusion MR produces estimates of fiber density (FD) and cross section (FC). Using these fixel measurements along with retinal imaging, we asked if individual differences in the estimated number of RGCs are correlated with individual differences in FD and FC measurements obtained from the optic tracts, and subsequent structures along the cortical visual pathway. We find that RGC endowment is correlated with optic tract FC, but not with FD. RGC cell number had a decreasing relationship with measurements from subsequent regions of the visual system (LGN volume, optic radiation FC/FD, and V1 surface area). However, we also found that the variations in each visual area were correlated with the variations in its immediately adjacent visual structure. We only observed these serial correlations when FC is used as the measure of interest for the optic tract and radiations, but no significant relationship was found when FD represented these white matter structures. From these results, we conclude that the variations in RGC endowment, LGN volume, and V1 surface area are better predicted by the overall cross section of the optic tract and optic radiations relative to the intra-axonal restricted signal component of these white matter pathways. Additionally, the presence of the significant correlations between adjacent, but not distant, anatomical structures suggest that there are multiple, local sources of anatomical variation along the visual pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different patterns of visual processing for shapes in V1 of mouse and monkey</a></h4>

              
                Recently, mice became a popular research model for the visual system including objects processing. However, while primates use their fovea to inspect objects at high resolution, mice have low visual acuity and lack a foveal region. Thus, how objects are encoded in the visual cortex of mice and whether monkeys and mice use similar neural mechanisms to discriminate between shapes, is unknown. Using voltage sensitive dye imaging, we investigated spatio-temporal patterns of population response in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice and monkeys to shape contours. Neural responses in mice showed blurred spatial patterns, low correlation to the original stimuli and only subtle spatial differences between the shapes. In contrast, the neural responses in monkey's V1 fovea, showed prominent differences between the shapes at sub-degree resolution with high resemblance to the original shapes, in agreement with a topographic code. Furthermore, the spatial patterns of neural synchronization in monkey's V1 suggested contour binding by synchrony, but not in mice V1. Finally, monkey's V1 responses at larger eccentricities resembled more to those in mice. These results may suggest that to discriminate between shapes, mice rely on neural processing of low-level cues, whereas monkeys rely more on a topographic code.

                Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is a systemic neurological disorder associated with the formation of toxic, pathological aggregates of proteins within the brain that lead to severe cognitive decline, and eventually, death. In normal physiological conditions, the brain rids itself of toxic proteins using various clearance mechanisms. The efficacy of brain clearance can be adversely affected by the presence of toxic proteins and is also known to decline with age. Motivated by recent findings, such as the connection between brain cerebrospinal fluid clearance and sleep, we propose a mathematical model coupling the progression of toxic proteins over the brain's structural network and protein clearance. The model is used to study the interplay between clearance in the brain, toxic seeding, brain network connectivity, aging, and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for the growing body of clinical results showing that clearance plays an important role in the etiology, progression and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

                Neural population dynamics are often highly coordinated, allowing task-related computations to be understood as neural trajectories through low-dimensional subspaces. How the network connectivity and input structure give rise to such activity can be investigated with the aid of low-rank recurrent neural networks, a recently-developed class of computational models which offer a rich theoretical framework linking the underlying connectivity structure to emergent low-dimensional dynamics. This framework has so far relied on the assumption of all-to-all connectivity, yet cortical networks are known to be highly sparse. Here we investigate the dynamics of low-rank recurrent networks in which the connections are randomly sparsified, which makes the network connectivity formally full-rank. We first analyse the impact of sparsity on the eigenvalue spectrum of low-rank connectivity matrices, and use this to examine the implications for the dynamics. We find that in the presence of sparsity, the eigenspectra in the complex plane consist of a continuous bulk and isolated outliers, a form analogous to the eigenspectra of connectivity matrices composed of a low-rank and a full-rank random component. This analogy allows us to characterise distinct dynamical regimes of the sparsified low-rank network as a function of key network parameters. Altogether, we find that the low-dimensional dynamics induced by low-rank connectivity structure are preserved even at high levels of sparsity, and can therefore support rich and robust computations even in networks sparsified to a biologically-realistic extent.

                Axonal swellings (AS) are the neuropathological hallmark of axonal injury in several disorders from trauma to neurodegeneration. Current evidence proposes a role of perturbed Ca2+ homeostasis in AS formation, involving impaired axonal transport and focal distension of the axons. Mechanisms of AS formation, in particular moments following injury, however, remain unknown. Here we show that AS form independently from intra-axonal Ca2+ changes, which are required primarily for the persistence of AS in time. We further show that the majority of axonal proteins undergoing de/phosphorylation immediately following injury belong to the cytoskeleton. This correlates with an increase in the distance of the actin/spectrin periodic rings and with microtubule tracks remodeling within AS. Observed cytoskeletal rearrangements support axonal transport without major interruptions. Our results demonstrate that the earliest axonal response to injury consists in physiological adaptations of axonal structure to preserve function rather than in immediate pathological events signaling axonal destruction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational analysis of memory consolidation following inhibitory avoidance (IA) training in adult and infant rats: critical roles of CaMKIIα and MeCP2</a></h4>

              
                Key features of long-term memory (LTM), such as its stability and persistence, are acquired during processes collectively referred to as consolidation. The dynamics of biological changes during consolidation are complex. In adult rodents, consolidation exhibits distinct periods during which the engram is more or less resistant to disruption. Moreover, the ability to consolidate memories differs during developmental periods. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying consolidation are poorly understood, the initial stages rely on interacting signaling pathways that regulate gene expression, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) dependent feedback loops. We investigated the ways in which these pathways may contribute to developmental and dynamical features of consolidation. A computational model of molecular processes underlying consolidation following inhibitory avoidance (IA) training in rats was developed. Differential equations described the actions of CaMKII, multiple feedback loops regulating BDNF expression, and several transcription factors including methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and SIN3 transcription regulator family member A (Sin3a). This model provides novel explanations for the (apparent) rapid forgetting of infantile memory and the temporal progression of memory consolidation in adults. Simulations predict that dual effects of MeCP2 on the expression of bdnf, and interaction between MeCP2 and CaMKII, play critical roles in the rapid forgetting of infantile memory and the progress of memory resistance to disruptions. These insights suggest new potential targets of therapy for memory impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A recurrent network architecture explains tectal activity dynamics and experience-dependent behaviour</a></h4>

              
                The ongoing activity of neuronal populations represents an internal brain state that influences how sensory information is processed to control behaviour. Conversely, external sensory inputs perturb network dynamics, resulting in lasting effects that persist beyond the duration of the stimulus. However, the relationship between these dynamics and circuit architecture and their impact on sensory processing, cognition and behaviour are poorly understood. By combining cellular-resolution calcium imaging with mechanistic network modelling, we aimed to infer the spatial and temporal network interactions in the zebrafish optic tectum that shape its ongoing activity and state-dependent responses to visual input. We showed that a simple recurrent network architecture, wherein tectal dynamics are dominated by fast, short range, excitation countered by long-lasting, activity-dependent suppression, was sufficient to explain multiple facets of population activity including intermittent bursting, trial-to-trial sensory response variability and spatially-selective response adaptation. Moreover, these dynamics also predicted behavioural trends such as selective habituation of visually evoked prey-catching responses. Overall, we demonstrate that a mechanistic circuit model, built upon a uniform recurrent connectivity motif, can estimate the incidental state of a dynamic neural network and account for experience-dependent effects on sensory encoding and visually guided behaviour.

	<p>The Hubel&amp;amp;ndash;Wiesel (HW) model is a classical neurobiological model for explaining the orientation selectivity of cortical cells. However, the HW model still has not been fully proved physiologically, and there are few concise but efficient systems to quantify and simulate the HW model and can be used for object orientation detection applications. To realize a straightforward and efficient quantitive method and validate the HW model&amp;amp;rsquo;s reasonability and practicality, we use McCulloch-Pitts (MP) neuron model to simulate simple cells and complex cells and implement an artificial visual system (AVS) for two-dimensional object orientation detection. First, we realize four types of simple cells that are only responsible for detecting a specific orientation angle locally. Complex cells are realized with the sum function. Every local orientation information of an object is collected by simple cells and subsequently converged to the corresponding same type complex cells for computing global activation degree. Finally, the global orientation is obtained according to the activation degree of each type of complex cell. Based on this scheme, an AVS for global orientation detection is constructed. We conducted computer simulations to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of our scheme and the AVS. Computer simulations show that the mechanism-based AVS can make accurate orientation discrimination and shows striking biological similarities with the natural visual system, which indirectly proves the rationality of the Hubel&amp;amp;ndash;Wiesel model. Furthermore, compared with traditional CNN, we find that our AVS beats CNN on orientation detection tasks in identification accuracy, noise resistance, computation and learning cost, hardware implementation, and reasonability.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SPOROS: A pipeline to analyze DISE/6mer seed toxicity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elizabeth T. Bartom, Masha Kocherginsky, Bidur Paudel, Aparajitha Vaidyanathan, Ashley Haluck-Kangas, Monal Patel, Kaitlyn L. O’Shea, Andrea E. Murmann, Marcus E. Peter</p>

microRNAs (miRNAs) are (18-22nt long) noncoding short (s)RNAs that suppress gene expression by targeting the 3’ untranslated region of target mRNAs. This occurs through the seed sequence located in position 2-7/8 of the miRNA guide strand, once it is loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). G-rich 6mer seed sequences can kill cells by targeting C-rich 6mer seed matches located in genes that are critical for cell survival. This results in induction of Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE), through a mechanism we have called 6mer seed toxicity. miRNAs are often quantified in cells by aligning the reads from small (sm)RNA sequencing to the genome. However, the analysis of any smRNA Seq data set for predicted 6mer seed toxicity requires an alternative workflow, solely based on the exact position 2–7 of any short (s)RNA that can enter the RISC. Therefore, we developed SPOROS, a semi-automated pipeline that produces multiple useful outputs to predict and compare 6mer seed toxicity of cellular sRNAs, regardless of their nature, between different samples. We provide two examples to illustrate the capabilities of SPOROS: Example one involves the analysis of RISC-bound sRNAs in a cancer cell line (either wild-type or two mutant lines unable to produce most miRNAs). Example two is based on a publicly available smRNA Seq data set from postmortem brains (either from normal or Alzheimer’s patients). Our methods (found at https://github.com/ebartom/SPOROS and at Code Ocean: https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.1732496.v1) are designed to be used to analyze a variety of smRNA Seq data in various normal and disease settings.

When responding to infectious disease outbreaks, rapid and accurate estimation of the epidemic trajectory is critical. However, two common data collection problems affect the reliability of the epidemiological data in real time: missing information on the time of first symptoms, and retrospective revision of historical information, including right censoring. Here, we propose an approach to construct epidemic curves in near real time that addresses these two challenges by 1) imputation of dates of symptom onset for reported cases using a dynamically-estimated “backward” reporting delay conditional distribution, and 2) adjustment for right censoring using the <i>NobBS</i> software package to nowcast cases by date of symptom onset. This process allows us to obtain an approximation of the time-varying reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>t</sub>) in real time. We apply this approach to characterize the early SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in two Spanish regions between March and April 2020. We evaluate how these real-time estimates compare with more complete epidemiological data that became available later. We explore the impact of the different assumptions on the estimates, and compare our estimates with those obtained from commonly used surveillance approaches. Our framework can help improve accuracy, quantify uncertainty, and evaluate frequently unstated assumptions when recovering the epidemic curves from limited data obtained from public health systems in other locations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantification of long-term doxorubicin response dynamics in breast cancer cell lines to direct treatment schedules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Grant R. Howard, Tyler A. Jost, Thomas E. Yankeelov, Amy Brock</p>

While acquired chemoresistance is recognized as a key challenge to treating many types of cancer, the dynamics with which drug sensitivity changes after exposure are poorly characterized. Most chemotherapeutic regimens call for repeated dosing at regular intervals, and if drug sensitivity changes on a similar time scale then the treatment interval could be optimized to improve treatment performance. Theoretical work suggests that such optimal schedules exist, but experimental confirmation has been obstructed by the difficulty of deconvolving the simultaneous processes of death, adaptation, and regrowth taking place in cancer cell populations. Here we present a method of optimizing drug schedules in vitro through iterative application of experimentally calibrated models, and demonstrate its ability to characterize dynamic changes in sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin in three breast cancer cell lines subjected to treatment schedules varying in concentration, interval between pulse treatments, and number of sequential pulse treatments. Cell populations are monitored longitudinally through automated imaging for 600–800 hours, and this data is used to calibrate a family of cancer growth models, each consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations, derived from the bi-exponential model which characterizes resistant and sensitive subpopulations. We identify a model incorporating both a period of growth arrest in surviving cells and a delay in the death of chemosensitive cells which outperforms the original bi-exponential growth model in Akaike Information Criterion based model selection, and use the calibrated model to quantify the performance of each drug schedule. We find that the inter-treatment interval is a key variable in determining the performance of sequential dosing schedules and identify an optimal retreatment time for each cell line which extends regrowth time by 40%-239%, demonstrating that the time scale of changes in chemosensitivity following doxorubicin exposure allows optimization of drug scheduling by varying this inter-treatment interval.

A study in PLoS Biology addresses this question and finds that most areas of the human cerebral cortex are linked by an astoundingly small number of fibers.

Activity patterns and complex functions of the brain rely on the characteristic communication network formed by axonal fiber networks, but how many axons actually connect different brain regions?

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Folliculin promotes substrate-selective mTORC1 activity by activating RagC to recruit TFE3</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kristina Li, Shogo Wada, Bridget S. Gosis, Chelsea Thorsheim, Paige Loose, Zolt Arany</p>

Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex I (mTORC1) is central to cellular metabolic regulation. mTORC1 phosphorylates a myriad of substrates, but how different substrate specificity is conferred on mTORC1 by different conditions remains poorly defined. Here, we show how loss of the mTORC1 regulator folliculin (FLCN) renders mTORC1 specifically incompetent to phosphorylate TFE3, a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis, without affecting phosphorylation of other canonical mTORC1 substrates, such as S6 kinase. FLCN is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RagC, a component of the mTORC1 amino acid (AA) sensing pathway, and we show that active RagC is necessary and sufficient to recruit TFE3 onto the lysosomal surface, allowing subsequent phosphorylation of TFE3 by mTORC1. Active mutants of RagC, but not of RagA, rescue both phosphorylation and lysosomal recruitment of TFE3 in the absence of FLCN. These data thus advance the paradigm that mTORC1 substrate specificity is in part conferred by direct recruitment of substrates to the subcellular compartments where mTORC1 resides and identify potential targets for specific modulation of specific branches of the mTOR pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Variable susceptibility of intestinal organoid–derived monolayers to SARS-CoV-2 infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kyung Ku Jang, Maria E. Kaczmarek, Simone Dallari, Ying-Han Chen, Takuya Tada, Jordan Axelrad, Nathaniel R. Landau, Kenneth A. Stapleford, Ken Cadwell</p>

Gastrointestinal effects associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are highly variable for reasons that are not understood. In this study, we used intestinal organoid–derived cultures differentiated from primary human specimens as a model to examine interindividual variability. Infection of intestinal organoids derived from different donors with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in orders of magnitude differences in virus replication in small intestinal and colonic organoid–derived monolayers. Susceptibility to infection correlated with angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (<i>ACE2</i>) expression level and was independent of donor demographic or clinical features. <i>ACE2</i> transcript levels in cell culture matched the amount of ACE2 in primary tissue, indicating that this feature of the intestinal epithelium is retained in the organoids. Longitudinal transcriptomics of organoid-derived monolayers identified a delayed yet robust interferon signature, the magnitude of which corresponded to the degree of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, virus with the Omicron variant spike (S) protein infected the organoids with the highest infectivity, suggesting increased tropism of the virus for intestinal tissue. These results suggest that heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 replication in intestinal tissues results from differences in ACE2 levels, which may underlie variable patient outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identification of substrates of palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 highlights roles of depalmitoylation in disulfide bond formation and synaptic function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erica L. Gorenberg, Sofia Massaro Tieze, Betül Yücel, Helen R. Zhao, Vicky Chou, Gregory S. Wirak, Susumu Tomita, TuKiet T. Lam, Sreeganga S. Chandra</p>

Loss-of-function mutations in the depalmitoylating enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a devastating neurodegenerative disease. The substrates of PPT1 are largely undescribed, posing a limitation on molecular dissection of disease mechanisms and therapeutic development. Here, we provide a resource identifying >100 novel PPT1 substrates. We utilized Acyl Resin-Assisted Capture (Acyl RAC) and mass spectrometry to identify proteins with increased in vivo palmitoylation in PPT1 knockout (KO) mouse brains. We then validated putative substrates through direct depalmitoylation with recombinant PPT1. This stringent screen elucidated diverse PPT1 substrates at the synapse, including channels and transporters, G-protein–associated molecules, endo/exocytic components, synaptic adhesion molecules, and mitochondrial proteins. Cysteine depalmitoylation sites in transmembrane PPT1 substrates frequently participate in disulfide bonds in the mature protein. We confirmed that depalmitoylation plays a role in disulfide bond formation in a tertiary screen analyzing posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Collectively, these data highlight the role of PPT1 in mediating synapse functions, implicate molecular pathways in the etiology of NCL and other neurodegenerative diseases, and advance our basic understanding of the purpose of depalmitoylation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The effect of apathy and compulsivity on planning and stopping in sequential decision-making</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jacqueline Scholl, Hailey A. Trier, Matthew F. S. Rushworth, Nils Kolling</p>

Real-life decision-making often comprises sequences of successive decisions about whether to take opportunities as they are encountered or keep searching for better ones instead. We investigated individual differences related to such sequential decision-making and link them especially to apathy and compulsivity in a large online sample (discovery sample: <i>n</i> = 449 and confirmation sample: <i>n</i> = 756). Our cognitive model revealed distinct changes in the way participants evaluated their environments and planned their own future behaviour. Apathy was linked to decision inertia, i.e., automatically persisting with a sequence of searches for longer than appropriate given the value of searching. Thus, despite being less motivated, they did not avoid the effort associated with longer searches. In contrast, compulsivity was linked to self-reported insensitivity to the cost of continuing with a sequence of searches. The objective measures of behavioural cost insensitivity were clearly linked to compulsivity only in the discovery sample. While the confirmation sample showed a similar effect, it did not reach significance. Nevertheless, in both samples, participants reported awareness of such bias (experienced as “overchasing”). In addition, this awareness made them report preemptively avoiding situations related to the bias. However, we found no evidence of them actually preempting more in the task, which might mean a misalignment of their metacognitive beliefs or that our behavioural measures were incomplete. In summary, individual variation in distinct, fundamental aspects of sequential decision-making can be linked to variation in 2 measures of behavioural traits associated with psychological illness in the normal population.

HAE-4 reduced Aβ plaques as well as Aβ-driven tau seeding/spreading and neuritic dystrophy. These results demonstrate that HAE-4 may provide therapeutic effects on amyloid removal and Aβ driven downstream consequences such as tauopathy. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Caffeine Consumption and Dementia: Are Lewy Bodies the Link?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the association between caffeine intake and cognitive impairment. Caffeine-neuropathology correlations and interactions with lifestyle and genetic factors impacting caffeine metabolism and response were also tested.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 888 participants aged 59+ years from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and 303,887 participants aged 55+ years from the UK Biobank (UKB). MAP participants took part in annual cognitive testing. Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical neurological examination and standardized criteria. A subset provided postmortem tissue for neuropathologic evaluation for common age-related diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease [AD], Lewy bodies, and vascular). For UKB, dementia was determined by linked hospital and death records. Self-reported caffeine intake was estimated using food-frequency questionnaires in both cohorts. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR), regression, and mixed models were used to examine associations of caffeine intake with incident dementia, cognitive decline, and neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In MAP, compared to ≤100 mg/day, caffeine intake &gt;100 mg/day was associated with a significantly higher HR (95% confidence interval [CI]) of all-cause (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.03–1.76) and AD (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.07–1.85) dementia. Caffeine intake was not associated with cognitive decline. In UKB, compared to ≤100 mg/day, the HRs (95% CI) of all-cause dementia for consuming 100 ≤ 200, 200 ≤ 300, 300 ≤ 400, and &gt; 400 mg/day were 0.83 (95% CI = 0.72–0.94), 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64–0.85), 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64–0.85), and 0.92 (95% CI = 0.79–1.08), respectively. Similar results were observed for Alzheimer's dementia. In MAP, caffeine intake was inversely associated with postmortem Lewy bodies but no other age-related pathologies. Caffeine intake &gt;100 mg/day was associated with lower neocortical type Lewy bodies (odds ratio (95%CI): 0.40 (95% CI = 0.21–0.75).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Caffeine intake was inconsistently associated with clinical dementia; potentially explained by cohort differences in underlying dementia etiology. Lewy bodies may link caffeine to lower risk in some persons. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) patients suffer from a cognitive and memory dysfunction. Because the hippocampus plays a key role in both cognition and memory, we tested for volumetric differences in the subfields of the hippocampus in ME/CFS. We estimated hippocampal subfield volumes for 25 ME/CFS patients who met Fukuda criteria only (ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub>), 18 ME/CFS patients who met the stricter ICC criteria (ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub>), and 25 healthy controls (HC). Group comparisons with HC detected extensive differences in subfield volumes in ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> but not in ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub>. ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients had significantly <i>larger</i> volume in the left subiculum head (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), left presubiculum head (<i>p</i> = 0.0020), and left fimbria (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Correlations of hippocampus subfield volumes with clinical measures were stronger in ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> than in ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub> patients. In ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub> patients, we detected positive correlations between fatigue and hippocampus subfield volumes and a negative correlation between sleep disturbance score and the right CA1 body volume. In ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients, we detected a strong negative relationship between fatigue and left hippocampus tail volume. Strong negative relationships were also detected between pain and SF36 physical scores and two hippocampal subfield volumes (left: GC-ML-DG head and CA4 head). Our study demonstrated that volumetric differences in hippocampal subfields have strong statistical inference for patients meeting the ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> case definition and confirms hippocampal involvement in the cognitive and memory problems of ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence implicates the <i>parafascicular nucleus</i> of the thalamus (Pf) in basal ganglia (BG)-related functions and pathologies. Despite Pf connectivity with all BG components, most attention is focused on the thalamostriatal system and an integrated view of thalamic information processing in this network is still lacking. Here, we addressed this question by recording the responses elicited by Pf activation in single neurons of the <i>substantia nigra pars reticulata</i> (SNr), the main BG output structure in rodents, in anesthetized mice. We performed optogenetic activation of Pf neurons innervating the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), or the SNr using virally mediated transcellular delivery of Cre from injection in either target in Rosa26-LoxP-stop-ChR2-EYFP mice to drive channelrhodopsin expression. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the striatum evoked an inhibition often followed by an excitation, likely resulting from the activation of the trans-striatal direct and indirect pathways, respectively. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the SNr or the STN triggered one or two early excitations, suggesting partial functional overlap of trans-subthalamic and direct thalamonigral projections. Excitations were followed in about half of the cases by an inhibition that might reflect recruitment of intranigral inhibitory loops. Finally, global Pf stimulation, electrical or optogenetic, elicited similar complex responses comprising up to four components: one or two short-latency excitations, an inhibition, and a late excitation. These data provide evidence for functional connections between the Pf and different BG components and for convergence of the information processed through these pathways in single SNr neurons, stressing their importance in regulating BG outflow.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Decoding grasp and speech signals from the cortical grasp circuit in a tetraplegic human</a></h4>

              
                Wandelt et al. study how signals from the human supramarginal gyrus, ventral premotor cortex, and somatosensory cortex can be used for brain-machine interfaces. The supramarginal gyrus and ventral premotor cortex encode grasp motor imagery, and the supramarginal gyrus encodes vocalized speech, indicating new target regions for grasp and speech BMI applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Digital restoration of the pectoral girdles of two Early Cretaceous birds, and implications for early flight evolution</a></h4>

              
                The morphology of the pectoral girdle, the skeletal structure connecting the wing to the body, is a key determinant of flight capability, but in some respects is poorly known among stem birds. Here, the pectoral girdles of the Early Cretaceous birds <i>Sapeornis</i> and <i>Piscivorenantiornis</i> are reconstructed for the first time based on computed tomography and three-dimensional visualization, revealing key morphological details that are important for our understanding of early flight evolution. <i>Sapeornis</i> exhibits a double articulation system (widely present in non-enantiornithine pennaraptoran theropods including crown birds) which involves, alongside the main scapula-coracoid joint, a small subsidiary joint, though variation exists with respect to the shape and size of the main and subsidiary articular contacts in non-enantiornithine pennaraptorans. This double articulation system contrasts with <i>Piscivorenantiornis</i> in which a spatially restricted scapula-coracoid joint formed by a single set of opposing articular surfaces, a feature also present in other members of Enantiornithines, a major clade of stem birds known only from the Cretaceous. The unique single articulation system may reflect correspondingly unique flight behavior in enantiornithine birds, but this hypothesis requires further investigation from a functional perspective. Our renderings indicate that both <i>Sapeornis</i> and <i>Piscivorenantiornis</i> had a partially closed triosseal canal (a passage for muscle tendon that plays a key role in raising the wing), and our study suggests that this type of triosseal canal occurred in all known non-euornithine birds except <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, representing a transitional stage in flight apparatus evolution before the appearance of a fully closed bony triosseal canal as in modern birds. Our study reveals additional lineage-specific variations in pectoral girdle anatomy, as well as significant modification of the pectoral girdle along the line to crown birds. These modifications produced diverse pectoral girdle morphologies among Mesozoic birds, which allowed a commensurate range of capability levels and styles to emerge during the early evolution of flight.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dedicated chaperones coordinate co-translational regulation of ribosomal protein production with ribosome assembly to preserve proteostasis</a></h4>

              
                The biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosomes involves the ordered assembly of around 80 ribosomal proteins. Supplying equimolar amounts of assembly-competent ribosomal proteins is complicated by their aggregation propensity and the spatial separation of their location of synthesis and pre-ribosome incorporation. Recent evidence has highlighted that dedicated chaperones protect individual, unassembled ribosomal proteins on their path to the pre-ribosomal assembly site. Here, we show that the co-translational recognition of Rpl3 and Rpl4 by their respective dedicated chaperone, Rrb1 or Acl4, reduces the degradation of the encoding <i>RPL3</i> and <i>RPL4</i> mRNAs in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. In both cases, negative regulation of mRNA levels occurs when the availability of the dedicated chaperone is limited and the nascent ribosomal protein is instead accessible to a regulatory machinery consisting of the nascent-polypeptide-associated complex and the Caf130-associated Ccr4-Not complex. Notably, deregulated expression of Rpl3 and Rpl4 leads to their massive aggregation and a perturbation of overall proteostasis in cells lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1. Taken together, we have uncovered an unprecedented regulatory mechanism that adjusts the de novo synthesis of Rpl3 and Rpl4 to their actual consumption during ribosome assembly and, thereby, protects cells from the potentially detrimental effects of their surplus production.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fear extinction is regulated by long noncoding RNA activity at the synapse</a></h4>

              
                Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a multidimensional class of regulatory molecules involved in many aspects of brain function. Emerging evidence indicates that lncRNAs are expressed at the synapse; however, a direct role for their activity in this subcellular compartment in memory formation has yet to be demonstrated. Using lncRNA capture-seq on synaptosomes, we identified a significant number of lncRNAs that accumulate at synapses within the infralimbic prefrontal cortex of adult male C57/Bl6 mice. Among these is a splice variant related to the stress-associated lncRNA, Gas5. RNA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry and single molecule imaging revealed that this Gas5 isoform, in association with the RNA binding proteins G3bp2 and Caprin1, regulates the activity-dependent trafficking and clustering of RNA granules in dendrites. In addition, we found that cell-type-specific, state-dependent, and synapse-specific knockdown of the Gas5 variant led to impaired fear extinction memory. These findings identify a new mechanism of fear extinction that involves the dynamic interaction between local lncRNA activity and the coordination of RNA condensates in the synaptic compartment.

                Dopaminergic neurons with distinct projection patterns and physiological properties compose memory subsystems in a brain. However, it is poorly understood whether or how they interact during complex learning. Here, we identify a feedforward circuit formed between dopamine subsystems and show that it is essential for second-order conditioning, an ethologically important form of higher-order associative learning. The Drosophila mushroom body comprises a series of dopaminergic compartments, each of which exhibits distinct memory dynamics. We find that a slow and stable memory compartment can serve as an effective <teacher> by instructing other faster and transient memory compartments via a single key interneuron, which we identify by connectome analysis and neurotransmitter prediction. This excitatory interneuron acquires enhanced response to reward-predicting odor after first-order conditioning and, upon activation, evokes dopamine release in the <student> compartments. These hierarchical connections between dopamine subsystems explain distinct properties of first- and second-order memory long known by behavioral psychologists.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping whole-brain projections of anatomically defined prefrontal neurons using combined 3D convolution networks</a></h4>

              
                Long-range axonal projections provide the foundation for functional connectivity between brain regions and are critical in the modulation of behavior. Descending projections from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to various target regions regulate critical behavioral functions including decision making, social behavior and mood. While specific mPFC projections have distinct behavioral roles, individual mPFC projection neurons can also innervate multiple target regions. Yet how mPFC projection neurons divide their axons across the brain is poorly understood. In this study, we mapped the axon collaterals of mPFC neurons that project to nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), or contralateral mPFC (cmPFC) in mice. We used tissue clearing and light sheet fluorescence microscopy to visualize the 3-D structure of axonal arbors across the intact brain. While machine learning can automate analysis of axons in images of cleared tissue, it is challenging to train a model that generalizes to all axonal structures because the appearance of axons varies by target region. In this study, we present DeepTraCE (Deep learning-based image Tracing with Combined-model Enhancement), a new strategy for axon segmentation and quantification in images of cleared tissue. DeepTraCE is based on the deep-learning framework TRAILMAP; it achieves highly accurate axon detection by combining multiple machine learning models that are each applied to different brain regions. Using DeepTraCE, we find that cmPFC, NAc, and VTA-projecting mPFC neurons represent largely separable classes with unique axon collaterals in cortical, olfactory, and thalamic regions, respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Incertohypothalamic A13 dopaminergic neurons are involved in fine forelimb movements but not reward</a></h4>

              
                Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing neurons of the dopamine (DA) cell group A13 are well-positioned to impact known dopamine-related functions since their descending projections innervate target regions that regulate vigilance, sensorimotor integration and execution. Despite this known connectivity little is known regarding the functionality of A13-DA circuits. Using TH-specific loss-of-function methodology and techniques to monitor population activity in transgenic rats in vivo we investigated the contribution of A13-DA neurons in reward and movement-related actions. Our work demonstrates a role for A13-DA neurons in grasping and handling of objects that is independent from reward. A13-DA neurons respond strongly when animals grab and manipulate food items while their inactivation or degeneration prevents animals from successfully doing so - a deficit partially attributed to a reduction in grip strength. In contrast, there was no relation between A13-DA activity and food-seeking behavior when animals were tested on a reward-based task that did not include a reaching/grasping response. Moreover, motivation for food was unaffected as goal-directed behavior for food items was in general intact following A13 neuronal inactivation/degeneration. These results demonstrate a functional role for A13-DA neurons in prehensile actions that are uncoupled from reward and as such position A13-DA neurons into the functional framework regarding centrally-located DA populations and their ability to coordinate movement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fear memory in humans is consolidated over time independent of sleep</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many pathological fear memories rely on processes of fear conditioning upon an aversive event. These fear memories may continue to change after acquisition, but the factors contributing to these changes are not well understood. Sleep is known to consolidate, strengthen and change newly acquired declarative and procedural memories. However, evidence on the role of time and sleep in the consolidation of fear memories is inconclusive. Here, we used highly sensitive electrophysiological measures to examine the development of fear-conditioned responses over time and sleep in humans. Methods: We assessed event-related brain potentials (ERP) in 18 healthy young individuals during fear conditioning before and after a 2-hour afternoon nap or a corresponding wake interval in a counterbalanced within-subject design. The procedure involved pairing a neutral tone (CS+) with a highly unpleasant sound (US). As a control, another neutral tone (CS-) was paired with a neutral sound. Fear responses were examined before the interval during a habituation phase and an acquisition phase as well as after the interval during an extinction phase and a re-acquisition phase. Results: Differential fear conditioning during acquisition was evidenced by a more negative slow ERP component preceding the CS+ compared to the CS- (stimulus-preceding negativity). This differential fear response was even stronger after the interval during re-acquisition compared to initial acquisition, but this effect was similarly pronounced after sleep and wakefulness. Conclusions: These findings suggest that fear memories are consolidated over time, with this effect being independent of intervening sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hypercaloric diet triggers transient molecular rearrangements of astrocytes selectively in the arcuate nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Hypothalamic astrocytes are particularly affected by energy-dense food consumption. How the anatomical location of these glial cells and their spatial molecular distribution in the arcuate nu-cleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) determine the cellular response to a high caloric diet remains unclear. In this study, we investigated their distinctive molecular responses following the expo-sure to a high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) diet, specifically in the ARC. Using RNA sequencing and proteomics, we showed that astrocytes have a distinct transcriptomic and proteomic profile de-pendent on their anatomical location, with a major proteomic reprogramming in hypothalamic astrocytes. By ARC single-cell sequencing, we observed that a HFHS diet dictates time- and cell- specific transcriptomic responses, revealing that astrocytes have the most distinct regulatory pat-tern compared to other cell types. Lastly, we topographically and molecularly characterized as-trocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein and/or aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family mem-ber L1 in the ARC, of which the abundance was significantly increased, as well as the alteration in their spatial and molecular profiles, with a HFHS diet. Together, our results provide a detailed multi-omics view on the spatial and temporal changes of astrocytes particularly in the ARC dur-ing different time points of adaptation to a high caloric diet.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neighbouring modifications interfere with the detection of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein at Serine 129: Revisiting the specificity of pS129 antibodies</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) within Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites, and other pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease and synucleinopathies have consistently been shown to accumulate in aggregated and phosphorylated forms of the protein, predominantly at Serine 129 (S129). Antibodies against phosphorylated S129 (pS129) have emerged as the primary tools to investigate, monitor, and quantify aSyn pathology in the brain and peripheral tissues. However, most of the antibodies and immunoassays aimed at detecting pS129-aSyn were developed based on the assumption that neighbouring post-translational modifications (PTMs) either do not co-occur with pS129 or do not influence its detection. Herein, we demonstrate that the co-occurrence of multiple pathology-associated C-terminal PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation at Tyrosine 125 or truncation at residue 133 or 135) differentially influences the detection of pS129-aSyn species by pS129-aSyn antibodies. These observations prompted us to systematically reassess the specificity of the most commonly used pS129 antibodies against monomeric and aggregated forms of pS129-aSyn in mouse brain slices, primary neurons, mammalian cells and seeding models of aSyn pathology formation. We identified two antibodies that are insensitive to pS129 neighbouring PTMs. However, consistent with previous reports, most pS129 antibodies showed cross-reactivity towards other proteins and often detected low and high molecular weight bands in aSyn knock-out samples that could be easily mistaken for monomeric or High Molecular Weight aggregates of aSyn. Our observations suggest that the pS129 antibodies do not capture the biochemical and morphological diversity of aSyn pathology. They also underscore the need for more specific pS129 antibodies, more thorough characterization and validation of existing antibodies, and the use of the appropriate protein standards and controls in future studies.

	<p>Dopamine transporter (DAT) is involved in dopamine (DA) reuptake in presynaptic terminals. Deletion of DAT results in a hyperdopaminergic KO-rat phenotype. To conduct our studies in heterozygous DAT rats, several pedigree lines were created, with known derivation of the allele (i.e., maternal or paternal). Our purpose was to elucidate the role of parental origin rather than maternal care, assessing if maternal maltreatments generated sequelae in female offspring. In the first experiment, female rats and their pups were observed during postnatal lactation. Control dams were WT and heterozygous ones were MAT (but K-MAT, with previous experience of early maltreatment by their KO adoptive dams). WT dams were highly attracted to their offspring (predictably, they spent a lot of time licking their pups); in contrast, K-MAT dams showed strangely comparable levels of caring for their pups and exploring the environment. Subsequently, peculiar features of the circadian cycle were found in adolescent rats with different epigenotypes (WT, MUX = offspring of MAT father, MIK = offspring of K-MAT dam). The MIK epigenotype produced locomotor hyperactivity also during resting hours, well above typical values. The MUX epigenotype, on the other hand, was less active and presented a depression-like profile. This study is unique: maltreatment was generated in a spontaneous way from a DAT-KO mother to offspring. We highlight how future studies will address separate contributions by genotype and upbringing. In conclusion, paternal-allele asset generates sequelae diametrically opposed to the inheritance of early maternal trauma.</p>

	<p>Virtual Reality (VR) emerges as a promising technology capable of creating different scenarios in which the body, environment, and brain are closely related, proving enhancements in the diagnosis and treatment of several spatial memory deficits. In recent years, human spatial navigation has increasingly been studied in interactive virtual environments. However, navigational tasks are still not completely adapted in immersive 3D VR systems. We stipulate that an immersive Radial Arm Maze (RAM) is an excellent instrument, allowing the participants to be physically active within the maze exactly as in the walking RAM version in reality modality. RAM is a behavioral ecological task that allows the analyses of different facets of spatial memory, distinguishing declarative components from procedural ones. In addition to describing the characteristics of RAM, we will also analyze studies in which RAM has been used in virtual modality to provide suggestions into RAM building in immersive modality.</p>

	<p>Humans are the only species capable of experiencing pleasure from esthetic stimuli, such as art and music. Neuroimaging evidence suggests that the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a critical role in esthetic judgments, both in music and in visual art. In the last decade, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been increasingly employed to shed light on the causal role of different brain regions contributing to esthetic appreciation. In Experiment #1, musician (N = 20) and non-musician (N = 20) participants were required to judge musical stimuli in terms of &amp;amp;ldquo;liking&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;emotions&amp;amp;rdquo;. No significant differences between groups were found, although musicians were slower than non-musicians in both tasks, likely indicating a more analytic judgment, due to musical expertise. Experiment #2 investigated the putative causal role of the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC) in the esthetic appreciation of music, by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Unlike previous findings in visual art, no significant effects of tDCS were found, suggesting that stimulating the left DLPFC is not enough to affect the esthetic appreciation of music, although this conclusion is based on negative evidence,.</p>

	<p>Social species perceive emotion via extracting diagnostic features of body movements. Although extensive studies have contributed to knowledge on how the entire body is used as context for decoding bodily expression, we know little about whether specific body parts (e.g., arms and legs) transmit enough information for body understanding. In this study, we performed behavioral experiments using the Bubbles paradigm on static body images to directly explore diagnostic body parts for categorizing angry, fearful and neutral expressions. Results showed that subjects recognized emotional bodies through diagnostic features from the torso with arms. We then conducted a follow-up functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on body part images to examine whether diagnostic parts modulated body-related brain activity and corresponding neural representations. We found greater activations of the extra-striate body area (EBA) in response to both anger and fear than neutral for the torso and arms. Representational similarity analysis showed that neural patterns of the EBA distinguished different bodily expressions. Furthermore, the torso with arms and whole body had higher similarities in EBA representations relative to the legs and whole body, and to the head and whole body. Taken together, these results indicate that diagnostic body parts (i.e., torso with arms) can communicate bodily expression in a detectable manner.</p>

                <p>DRG neurons are classified into distinct types to mediate the somatosensation with different modalities. Recently, transcriptional profilings of DRG neurons by single-cell RNA-sequencing have provided new insights into the neuron typing and functional properties. Zinc-finger CCHC domain-containing 12 (<I>Zcchc12</I>) was reported to be the representative marker for a subtype of galanin-positive (<I>Gal</I><sup>+</sup>) DRG neurons. However, the characteristics and functions of <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons are largely unknown. Here, we genetically labeled <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons in <I>Zcchc12</I>-CreERT2::Ai9 mice, and verified that <I>Zcchc12</I> represented a new subpopulation of DRG neurons in both sexes. <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons centrally innervated the superficial laminae in spinal dorsal horn, and peripherally terminated as free nerve endings in the epidermis and cluster-shaped fibers in the dermis of footpads and nearby. In addition, <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons also formed circumferential endings surrounding the hair follicles in hairy skin. Functionally, <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging in DRGs revealed that <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> neurons were polymodal nociceptors and could be activated by mechanical and noxious thermal stimuli. Behavioral tests showed that selective ablation of <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> DRG neurons reduced the sensitivity to noxious heat in mice. Together, we identified a new subpopulation of <I>Zcchc12</I><sup>+</sup> nociceptors essential for noxious heat sensation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ipsilateral Stimulus Encoding in Primary and Secondary Somatosensory Cortex of Awake Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lateralization is a hallmark of somatosensory processing in the mammalian brain. However, in addition to their contralateral representation, unilateral tactile stimuli also modulate neuronal activity in somatosensory cortices of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The cellular organization and functional role of these ipsilateral stimulus responses in awake somatosensory cortices, especially regarding stimulus coding, are unknown. Here, we targeted silicon probe recordings to the vibrissa region of primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex of awake head-fixed mice of either sex while delivering ipsilateral and contralateral whisker stimuli. Ipsilateral stimuli drove larger and more reliable responses in S2 than in S1, and activated a larger fraction of stimulus-responsive neurons. Ipsilateral stimulus-responsive neurons were rare in layer 4 of S1, but were located in equal proportion across all layers in S2. Linear classifier analyses further revealed that decoding of the ipsilateral stimulus was more accurate in S2 than S1, whereas S1 decoded contralateral stimuli most accurately. These results reveal substantial encoding of ipsilateral stimuli in S1 and especially S2, consistent with the hypothesis that higher cortical areas may integrate tactile inputs across larger portions of space, spanning both sides of the body.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tactile information obtained by one side of the body is represented in the activity of neurons of the opposite brain hemisphere. However, unilateral tactile stimulation also modulates neuronal activity in the other, or ipsilateral, brain hemisphere. This ipsilateral activity may play an important role in the representation and processing of tactile information, in particular when the sense of touch involves both sides of the body. Our work in the whisker system of awake mice reveals that neocortical ipsilateral activity, in particular that of deep layer excitatory neurons of secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), contains information about the presence and the velocity of unilateral tactile stimuli, which supports a key role for S2 in integrating tactile information across both body sides.</p>

                <p>The ventral striatum is implicated in the affective processing of reward, which can be divided into a motivational and a hedonic component. Here, we examined whether these two components rely on distinct neural substrates within the ventral striatum in humans (11 females and 13 males). We used a high-resolution fMRI protocol targeting the ventral striatum combined with a pavlovian-instrumental task and a hedonic reactivity task. Both tasks involved an olfactory reward, thereby allowing us to measure pavlovian-triggered motivation and sensory pleasure for the same reward within the same participants. Our findings show that different subregions of the ventral striatum are dissociable in their contributions to the motivational versus the hedonic component of the affective processing of reward. Parsing the neural mechanisms of the interplay between pavlovian incentive and hedonic processes may have important implications for understanding compulsive reward-seeking behaviors such as addiction, binge eating, or gambling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Calretinin-Expressing Synapses Show Improved Synaptic Efficacy with Reduced Asynchronous Release during High-Rate Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Calretinin (CR) is a major calcium binding protein widely expressed in the CNS. However, its synaptic function remains largely elusive. At the auditory synapse of the endbulb of Held, CR is selectively expressed in different subtypes. Combining electrophysiology with immunohistochemistry, we investigated the synaptic transmission at the endbulb of Held synapses with and without endogenous CR expression in mature CBA/CAJ mice of either sex. Two synapse subtypes showed similar basal synaptic transmission, except a larger quantal size in CR-expressing synapses. During high-rate stimulus trains, CR-expressing synapses showed improved synaptic efficacy with significantly less depression and lower asynchronous release, suggesting more efficient exocytosis than non-CR-expressing synapses. Conversely, CR-expressing synapses had a smaller readily releasable pool size, which was countered by higher release probability and faster synaptic recovery to support sustained release during high-rate activity. EGTA-AM treatment did not change the synaptic transmission of CR-expressing synapses, but reduced synaptic depression and decreased asynchronous release at non-CR-expressing synapses, suggesting that CR helps to minimize calcium accumulation during high-rate activity. Both synapses express parvalbumin, another calcium-binding protein with slower kinetics and higher affinity than CR, but not calbindin. Furthermore, CR-expressing synapses only express the fast isoform of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1), while most non-CR-expressing synapses express both VGluT1 and the slower VGluT2, which may underlie their lagged synaptic recovery. The findings suggest that, paired with associated synaptic machinery, differential CR expression regulates synaptic efficacy among different subtypes of auditory nerve synapses to accomplish distinctive physiological functions in transmitting auditory information at high rates.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> CR is a major calcium-binding protein in the brain. It remains unclear how endogenous CR impacts synaptic transmission. We investigated the question at the large endbulb of Held synapses with selective CR expression and found that CR-expressing and non-CR-expressing synapses had similar release properties under basal synaptic transmission. During high-rate activity, however, CR-expressing synapses showed improved synaptic efficacy with less depression, lower asynchronous release, and faster recovery. Furthermore, CR-expressing synapses use exclusive VGluT1 to refill synaptic vesicles, while non-CR-expressing synapses use both VGluT1 and the slower isoform of VGluT2. Our findings suggest that CR may play significant roles in promoting synaptic efficacy during high-rate activity, and selective CR expression can differentially impact signal processing among different synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Medial Orbitofrontal-Striatal Circuits Support Dissociable Component Processes of Risk/Reward Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>The medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) regulates a variety of cognitive functions, including refining action selection involving reward uncertainty. This region sends projections to numerous subcortical targets, including the ventral and dorsal striatum, yet how these corticostriatal circuits differentially regulate risk/reward decision-making is unknown. The present study examined the contribution of mOFC circuits linking the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to risk/reward decision-making using pharmacological disconnections. Male rats were well trained on a probabilistic discounting task involving choice between small/certain or large/risky rewards, with the probability of obtaining the larger reward decreasing or increasing over a session. Disconnection of mOFC-striatal pathways was achieved using infusions of GABA agonists inactivating the mOFC in one hemisphere, combined with NAc or DMS inactivation in the contralateral or ipsilateral hemisphere. Perturbing mOFC -&gt; NAc circuits induced suboptimal, near-random patterns of choice that manifested as a flattening of the discounting curve. Animals were equally likely to stay or shift following rewarded/nonrewarded choices, suggesting this pathway mediates use of information about reward history to stabilize decision biases. In contrast, mOFC -&gt; DMS disconnection impaired adjustments in decision biases, causing opposing changes in risky choice depending on how probabilities varied over time. This was driven by alterations in lose-shift behavior, suggesting mOFC -&gt; DMS circuits track volatility in nonrewarded actions to adjust choice in accordance with changes in profitability. Thus, separate mOFC-striatal projection pathways regulate dissociable processes underlying decision-making, with mOFC -&gt; NAc circuits aiding in establishing and stabilizing tasks states and mOFC -&gt; DMS circuits facilitating transitions across states to promote flexible reward seeking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The medial orbitofrontal cortex regulates a variety of goal-directed behaviors, yet the functional circuits through which it mediates higher order decision-making functions are unclear. The present study revealed that different mOFC projection pathways facilitate diverse aspects of decision-making involving risks and rewards by engaging separate networks of neurons that interface with distinct ventral and dorsal striatal targets. These findings clarify some of the normal functions of these corticostriatal pathways and may have implications for understanding how dysfunction in these circuits relate to certain psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrated Amygdala, Orbitofrontal and Hippocampal Contributions to Reward and Loss Coding Revealed with Human Intracranial EEG</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurophysiological work in primates and rodents have shown the amygdala plays a central role in reward processing through connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus. However, understanding the role of oscillations in each region and their connectivity in different stages of reward processing in humans has been hampered by limitations with noninvasive methods such as poor spatial and temporal resolution. To overcome these limitations, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) directly from the amygdala, OFC and hippocampus simultaneously in human male and female epilepsy patients performing a monetary incentive delay (MID) task. This allowed us to dissociate electrophysiological activity and connectivity patterns related to the anticipation and receipt of rewards and losses in real time. Anticipation of reward increased high-frequency gamma (HFG; 60&ndash;250 Hz) activity in the hippocampus and theta band (4&ndash;8 Hz) synchronization between amygdala and OFC, suggesting roles in memory and motivation. During receipt, HFG in the amygdala was involved in outcome value coding, the OFC cue context-specific outcome value comparison and the hippocampus reward coding. Receipt of loss decreased amygdala-hippocampus theta and increased amygdala-OFC HFG amplitude coupling which coincided with subsequent adjustments in behavior. Increased HFG synchronization between the amygdala and hippocampus during reward receipt suggested encoding of reward information into memory for reinstatement during anticipation. These findings extend what is known about the primate brain to humans, showing key spectrotemporal coding and communication dynamics for reward and punishment related processes which could serve as more precise targets for neuromodulation to establish causality and potential therapeutic applications.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dysfunctional reward processing contributes to many psychiatric disorders. Neurophysiological work in primates has shown the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and hippocampus play a synergistic role in reward processing. However, because of limitations with noninvasive imaging, it is unclear whether the same interactions occur in humans and what oscillatory mechanisms underpin them. We addressed this issue by recording local field potentials (LFPs) from all three regions in human epilepsy patients during monetary reward processing. There was increased amygdala-OFC high-frequency coupling when losing money which coincided with subsequent adjustments in behavior. In contrast, increased amygdala-hippocampus high-frequency phase-locking suggested a role in reward memory. The findings highlight amygdala networks for reward and punishment processes that could act as more precise neuromodulation targets to treat psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Neural Representations of Emotional Experiences Are More Similar Than Those of Neutral Experiences</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stimuli that evoke the same feelings can nevertheless look different and have different semantic meanings. Although we know much about the neural representation of emotion, the neural underpinnings of emotional similarity are unknown. One possibility is that the same brain regions represent similarity between emotional and neutral stimuli, perhaps with different strengths. Alternatively, emotional similarity could be coded in separate regions, possibly those sensitive to emotional valence and arousal. In behavior, the extent to which people consider similarity along emotional dimensions when they evaluate the overall similarity between stimuli has never been investigated. Although the emotional features of stimuli may dominate explicit ratings of similarity, it is also possible that people neglect emotional dimensions as irrelevant to that judgment. We contrasted these hypotheses in (male and female) healthy controls using two measures of similarity and two picture databases of complex negative and neutral scenes, the second of which provided exquisite control over semantic and visual attributes. The similarity between emotional stimuli was greater than between neutral stimuli in the inferior temporal cortex, the fusiform face area, and the precuneus. Additionally, only the similarity between emotional stimuli was significantly represented in early visual cortex, anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Intriguingly, despite the stronger neural similarity between emotional stimuli, the same participants did not rate them as more similar to each other than neutral stimuli. These results contribute to our understanding of how emotion is represented within a general conceptual workspace and of the overgeneralization bias in anxiety disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We tested differences in similarity between emotional and neutral scenes. Arousal and negative valence did not increase similarity ratings. When conditions were equated on semantic similarity, participants rated emotional stimuli as similar to each other as neutral ones. Despite this equivalence, the similarity among the neural representations of emotional compared with neutral stimuli was higher in regions, which also expressed similarity between neutral stimuli and in unique regions. We report a striking difference between behavioral and neural similarity; strong neural similarity between emotional pictures did not influence similarity judgements in the same participants in the behavioral rating task after the scan. These findings may have an impact on research about the neural representations of emotional categories and the overgeneralization bias in anxiety disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors Expressed by Striatal Interneurons Inhibit Striatal Activity and Control Striatal-Dependent Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Acetylcholine is an important modulator of striatal activity, and it is vital to controlling striatal-dependent behaviors, including motor and cognitive functions. Despite this significance, the mechanisms determining how acetylcholine impacts striatal signaling are still not fully understood. In particular, little is known about the role of nAChRs expressed by striatal interneurons. In the present study, we used FISH to determine which neuronal types express the most prevalent beta2 nicotinic subunit in the mouse striatum. Our data support a common view that nAChR expression is mostly restricted to striatal interneurons. Surprisingly though, cholinergic interneurons were identified as a population with the highest expression of beta2 nicotinic subunit. To investigate the functional significance of beta2-containing nAChRs in striatal interneurons, we deleted them by injecting the AAV-Cre vector into the striatum of <I>beta2-flox/flox</I> male mice. The deletion led to alterations in several behavioral domains, namely, to an increased anxiety-like behavior, decrease in sociability ratio, deficit in discrimination learning, and increased amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and c-Fos expression in mice with beta2 deletion. Further colocalization analysis showed that the increased c-Fos expression was present in both medium spiny neurons and presumed striatal interneurons. The present study concludes that, despite being relatively rare, beta2-containing nAChRs are primarily expressed in striatal neurons by cholinergic interneurons and play a significant role in behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A large variety of nAChRs are expressed in the striatum, a brain region that is crucial in the control of behavior. The complexity of receptors with different functions is hindering our understanding of mechanisms through which striatal acetylcholine modulates behavior. We focused on the role of a small population of beta2-containing nAChRs. We identified neuronal types expressing these receptors and determined their impact in the control of explorative behavior, anxiety-like behavior, learning, and sensitivity to stimulants. Additional experiments showed that these alterations were associated with an overall increased activity of striatal neurons. Thus, the small population of nicotinic receptors represents an interesting target for a modulation of response to stimulant drugs and other striatal-based behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Critical Period for Development of Cerebellar-Mediated Autism-Relevant Social Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cerebellum has been increasingly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with many ASD-linked genes impacting both cerebellar function and development. However, the precise timing and critical periods of when abnormal cerebellar neurodevelopment contributes to ASD-relevant behaviors remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a critical period for the development of ASD-relevant behaviors in a cerebellar male mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), by using the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin, to pharmacologically inhibit dysregulated downstream signaling. We find independent critical periods during which abnormal ASD-relevant behaviors develop for the two core ASD diagnostic criteria, social impairments and behavioral flexibility, and delineate an anatomic, physiological, and behavioral framework. These findings not only further our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the timing of ASD-relevant behaviors but also have the capacity to inform potential therapies to optimize treatment interventions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> No targeted treatments currently exist for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This complex developmental disorder has established links to genetic and circuit aberrations, yet the precise timing and coordination of these underlying mechanisms that contribute to the spectrum of physiological and behavioral abnormalities remains unclear. Cerebellar pathology is consistently seen in ASD individuals; therefore, we sought to identify the specific windows for cerebellar involvement in the development of ASD-relevant behaviors. Using pharmacologic treatment paradigms, we outline distinct critical periods of developmental vulnerability for ASD-relevant social and inflexible behaviors. From this study, we posit a refined window of time during which ASD symptoms develop that will inform therapeutic timing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The ZIP3 Zinc Transporter Is Localized to Mossy Fiber Terminals and Is Required for Kainate-Induced Degeneration of CA3 Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tight regulation of neuronal Zn<sup>2+</sup> is critical for physiological function. Multiple Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporters are expressed in the brain, yet their spatial distribution and distinct roles are largely unknown. Here, we show developmental regulation of the expression of Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporters ZIP1 and ZIP3 in mouse hippocampal neurons, corresponding to previously described increase in neuronal vesicular Zn<sup>2+</sup> during the first postnatal month. Rates of Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, monitored using FluoZin-3 fluorescence, were higher in mature neurons, which express higher levels of ZIP1 and ZIP3. Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake was attenuated by ~50% following silencing of either ZIP1 or ZIP3. Expression of both ZIP1 and ZIP3 was ubiquitous on somas and most neuronal processes in the cultured neurons. In contrast, we observed distinct localization of the transporters in adult mouse hippocampal brain, with ZIP1 predominantly expressed in the CA3 stratum pyramidale, and ZIP3 primarily localized to the stratum lucidum. Consistent with their localization, silencing of ZIP1 expression <I>in vivo</I> reduced Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake in CA3 neurons while ZIP3 silencing reduced Zn<sup>2+</sup> influx into dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells in acute hippocampal slices. Strikingly, <I>in vivo</I> silencing of ZIP3, but not ZIP1, protected CA3 neurons from neurodegeneration following kainate-induced seizures. Our results indicate that distinct Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporters control Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and toxicity in different neuronal populations in the hippocampus and suggest that selective regulation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporters can prevent seizure induced brain damage.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Zinc plays a major role in neuronal function and its dysregulation is associated with neurodegeneration. Multiple zinc transporters are expressed in neurons, yet little is known on their distinct roles. Here, we show that the plasma membrane ZIP1 and ZIP3 zinc transporters are expressed on distinct neuronal populations in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. We show that ZIP1 mediates zinc influx into postsynaptic cells, while ZIP3 is responsible for zinc re-uptake from this synapse into dentate granule cells. We further show that silencing of ZIP3, but not ZIP1, can rescue the postsynaptic cells from kainate-induced neurodegeneration. This suggests that neuronal zinc toxicity and degeneration can be modulated by regulation of specific zinc transporters function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Striatal Indirect Pathway Dysfunction Underlies Motor Deficits in a Mouse Model of Paroxysmal Dyskinesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abnormal involuntary movements, or dyskinesias, are seen in many neurologic diseases, including disorders where the brain appears grossly normal. This observation suggests that alterations in neural activity or connectivity may underlie dyskinesias. One influential model proposes that involuntary movements are driven by an imbalance in the activity of striatal direct and indirect pathway neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs, respectively). Indeed, in some animal models, there is evidence that dMSN hyperactivity contributes to dyskinesia. Given the many diseases associated with dyskinesia, it is unclear whether these findings generalize to all forms. Here, we used male and female mice in a mouse model of paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) to assess whether involuntary movements are related to aberrant activity in the striatal direct and indirect pathways. In this model, as in the human disorder PNKD, animals experience dyskinetic attacks in response to caffeine or alcohol. Using optically identified striatal single-unit recordings in freely moving PNKD mice, we found a loss of iMSN firing during dyskinesia bouts. Further, chemogenetic inhibition of iMSNs triggered dyskinetic episodes in PNKD mice. Finally, we found that these decreases in iMSN firing are likely because of aberrant endocannabinoid-mediated suppression of glutamatergic inputs. These data show that striatal iMSN dysfunction contributes to the etiology of dyskinesia in PNKD, and suggest that indirect pathway hypoactivity may be a key mechanism for the generation of involuntary movements in other disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Involuntary movements, or dyskinesias, are part of many inherited and acquired neurologic syndromes. There are few effective treatments, most of which have significant side effects. Better understanding of which cells and patterns of activity cause dyskinetic movements might inform the development of new neuromodulatory treatments. In this study, we used a mouse model of an inherited human form of paroxysmal dyskinesia in combination with cell type-specific tools to monitor and manipulate striatal activity. We were able to narrow in on a specific group of neurons that causes dyskinesia in this model, and found alterations in a well-known form of plasticity in this cell type, endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic LTD. These findings point to new areas for therapeutic development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Morphology and Dendrite-Specific Synaptic Properties of Midbrain Neurons Shape Multimodal Integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multimodal integration facilitates object recognition and response to sensory cues. This depends on spatiotemporal coincidence of sensory information, recruitment of NMDA-type glutamate receptors and inhibitory feedback. Shepherd's crook neurons (SCNs) in the avian optic tectum (TeO) are an ideal model for studying cellular mechanism of multimodal integration. They receive different sensory modalities through spatially segregated dendrites, are important for stimulus selection and have an axon-carrying dendrite (AcD). We performed whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in chicken midbrain slices of both sexes. We emulated visual and auditory input <I>in vitro</I> by stimulating presynaptic afferents electrically. Simultaneous stimulation enhanced responses inversely depending on stimulation amplitude demonstrating the principle of inverse effectiveness. Contribution of NMDA-type glutamate receptors prolonged postsynaptic events for visual inputs only, causing a strong modality-specific difference in synaptic efficacy. We designed a multicompartment model to study the effect of morphological and physiological parameters on multimodal integration by varying the distance between soma and axonal origin and the amount of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) contribution. These parameters changed the preference of the model for one input channel and adjusted the range of input rates at which multimodal enhancement occurred on naturalistic stimulation. Thus, the unique morphology and synaptic features of SCNs shape the integration of input at different dendrites and generates an enhanced multimodal response.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Multimodal integration improves perception and responses to objects. The underlying cellular mechanism depends on a balance between excitation and inhibition, and NMDA-type glutamate receptors that are involved in the multiplicative nature of enhancement following the principle of inverse effectiveness. Based on a detailed analysis of an identified multimodal cell type in the vertebrate midbrain, we studied the influence of cellular morphology and unimodal synaptic properties on multimodal integration. We can show that the combination of cellular morphology and modality-specific synaptic properties including NMDA receptor (NMDAR) contribution is optimal for nonlinear, multimodal enhancement and determines the dynamic response range of the integrating neuron. Our findings mechanistically explain how synaptic properties and cellular morphology of a midbrain neuron contribute to multimodal enhancement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Metabolite Saccharopine Impairs Neuronal Development by Inhibiting the Neurotrophic Function of Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mutations in the <I>Aminoadipate-Semialdehyde Synthase</I> (<I>AASS</I>) gene encoding &alpha;-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase lead to hyperlysinemia-I, a benign metabolic variant without clinical significance, and hyperlysinemia-II with developmental delay and intellectual disability. Although both forms of hyperlysinemia display biochemical phenotypes of questionable clinical significance, an association between neurologic disorder and a pronounced biochemical abnormality remains a challenging clinical question. Here, we report that Aass mutant male and female mice carrying the R65Q mutation in &alpha;-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) domain have an elevated cerebral lysine level and a normal brain development, whereas the Aass mutant mice carrying the G489E mutation in saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) domain exhibit elevations of both cerebral lysine and saccharopine levels and a smaller brain with defective neuronal development. Mechanistically, the accumulated saccharopine, but not lysine, leads to impaired neuronal development by inhibiting the neurotrophic effect of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI). While extracellular supplementation of GPI restores defective neuronal development caused by G498E mutation in SDH of Aass. Altogether, our findings not only unravel the requirement for saccharopine degradation in neuronal development, but also provide the mechanistic insights for understanding the neurometabolic disorder of hyperlysinemia-II.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Behavioral Timescale Cooperativity and Competitive Synaptic Interactions Regulate the Induction of Complex Spike Burst-Dependent Long-Term Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although Hebbian LTP has an important role in memory formation, the properties of Hebbian LTP cannot fully account for, and in some cases seem incompatible with, fundamental properties of associative learning. Importantly, findings from computational and neurophysiological studies suggest that burst-dependent forms of plasticity, where dendritic spikes and bursts of action potentials provide the postsynaptic depolarization needed for LTP induction, may overcome some of the limitations of conventional Hebbian LTP. Thus, I investigated how excitatory synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells interact during the induction of complex spike (CS) burst-dependent LTP in hippocampal slices from male mice. Consistent with previous findings, theta-frequency trains of synaptic stimulation induce a Hebbian form of plasticity where postsynaptic CS bursts provide the depolarization needed for NMDAR activation and LTP induction. However, in contrast to conventional Hebbian plasticity, where cooperative LTP induction requires coactivation of synapses on a timescale of tens of milliseconds, cooperative interactions between synapses activated several seconds apart can induce CS burst-dependent LTP. A novel, retroactive form of heterosynaptic plasticity, where activation of one group of synapses triggers LTP induction at other synapses that were active seconds earlier, also contributes to cooperativity in CS burst-dependent LTP. Moreover, competitive synaptic interactions that emerge during prolonged bouts of postsynaptic CS bursting potently regulate CS burst-dependent LTP. Together, the unusual properties of synaptic cooperativity and competition in CS burst-dependent LTP enable Hebbian synapses to operate and interact on behavioral timescales.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While EPSP-evoked complex spike (CS) bursting induces LTP at excitatory synapses onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, the properties of synaptic interactions during the induction of CS burst-dependent LTP have not been investigated. Here I report that interactions between independent synaptic inputs during the induction of CS burst-dependent LTP exhibit a number of novel, computationally relevant properties. Unlike conventional Hebbian LTP, the induction of CS burst-dependent LTP is regulated by proactive and retroactive cooperative interactions between synapses activated several seconds apart. Moreover, activity-dependent, competitive interactions between synapses allow strongly activated synapses to suppress LTP induction at more weakly activated synapses. Thus, CS burst-dependent LTP exhibits a number of the unique properties that overcome significant limitations of standard Hebbian plasticity rules.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">APT1-Mediated Depalmitoylation Regulates Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Palmitoylation may be relevant to the processes of learning and memory, and even disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and aging-related cognitive decline. However, underlying mechanisms of palmitoylation in these processes remain unclear. Herein, we used acyl-biotin exchange, coimmunoprecipitation and biotinylation assays, and behavioral and electrophysiological methods, to explore whether palmitoylation is required for hippocampal synaptic transmission and fear memory formation, and involved in functional modification of synaptic proteins, such as postsynapse density-95 (PSD-95) and glutamate receptors, and detected if depalmitoylation by specific enzymes has influence on glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. Our results showed that global palmitoylation level, palmitoylation of PSD-95 and glutamate receptors, postsynapse density localization of PSD-95, surface expression of AMPARs, and synaptic strength of cultured hippocampal neurons were all enhanced by TTX pretreatment, and these can be reversed by inhibition of palmitoylation with palmitoyl acyl transferases inhibitors, 2-bromopalmitate and N-(tert-butyl) hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Importantly, we also found that acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1)-mediated depalmitoylation is involved in palmitoylation of PSD-95 and glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Knockdown of APT1, not protein palmitoyl thioesterase 1, with shRNA, or selective inhibition, significantly increased AMPAR-mediated synaptic strength, palmitoylation levels, and synaptic or surface expression of PSD-95 and AMPARs. Results from hippocampal tissues and fear-conditioned rats showed that palmitoylation is required for synaptic strengthening and fear memory formation. These results suggest that palmitoylation and APT1-mediated depalmitoylation have critical effects on the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and it may serve as a potential target for learning and memory-associated disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fear-related anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, are prevalent psychiatric conditions, and fear memory is associated with hyperexcitability in the hippocampal CA1 region. Palmitoylation is involved in learning and memory, but mechanisms coupling palmitoylation with fear memory acquisition remain poorly understood. This study demonstrated that palmitoylation is essential for postsynapse density-95 clustering and hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and APT1-mediated depalmitoylation plays critical roles in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Our study revealed that molecular mechanism about downregulation of APT1 leads to enhancement of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, and that palmitoylation cycling is implicated in fear conditioning-induced synaptic strengthening and fear memory formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">AMIGO1 Promotes Axon Growth and Territory Matching in the Retina</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dendrite and axon arbor sizes are critical to neuronal function and vary widely between different neuron types. The relative dendrite and axon sizes of synaptic partners control signal convergence and divergence in neural circuits. The developmental mechanisms that determine cell-type-specific dendrite and axon size and match synaptic partners' arbor territories remain obscure. Here, we discover that retinal horizontal cells express the leucine-rich repeat domain cell adhesion molecule AMIGO1. Horizontal cells provide pathway-specific feedback to photoreceptors&mdash;horizontal cell axons to rods and horizontal cell dendrites to cones. AMIGO1 selectively expands the size of horizontal cell axons. When <I>Amigo1</I> is deleted in all or individual horizontal cells of either sex, their axon arbors shrink. By contrast, horizontal cell dendrites and synapse formation of horizontal cell axons and dendrites are unaffected by AMIGO1 removal. The dendrites of rod bipolar cells, which do not express AMIGO1, shrink in parallel with horizontal cell axons in <I>Amigo1 knockout</I> (<I>Amigo1 KO</I>) mice. This territory matching maintains the function of the rod bipolar pathway, preserving bipolar cell responses and retinal output signals in <I>Amigo1 KO</I> mice. We previously identified AMIGO2 as a scaling factor that constrains retinal neurite arbors. Our current results identify AMIGO1 as a scaling factor that expands retinal neurite arbors and reveal territory matching as a novel homeostatic mechanism. Territory matching interacts with other homeostatic mechanisms to stabilize the development of the rod bipolar pathway, which mediates vision near the threshold.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons send and receive signals through branched axonal and dendritic arbors. The size of these arbors is critical to the function of a neuron. Axons and dendrites grow during development and are stable at maturity. The mechanisms that determine axon and dendrite size are not well understood. Here, we identify a cell surface protein, AMIGO1, that selectively promotes axon growth of horizontal cells, a retinal interneuron. Removal of AMIGO1 reduces the size of horizontal cell axons without affecting the size of their dendrites or the ability of both arbors to form connections. The changes in horizontal cell axons are matched by changes in synaptic partner dendrites to stabilize retinal function. This identifies territory matching as a novel homeostatic plasticity mechanism.</p>

     alt="Identification and characterization of rostral ventromedial medulla neurons synaptically connected to the urinary bladder afferents in female rats with or without neonatal cystitis"/>
<p>Talluri et al identified and characterized rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and the colon and studied the effect of early life bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. They demonstrated alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in bladder-related RVM neurons in rats with neonatal cystitis.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) play a major role in pain modulation. We have previously shown that early-life noxious bladder stimuli in rats resulted in an overall spinal GABAergic disinhibition and a long-lasting bladder/colon sensitization when tested in adulthood. However, the neuromolecular alterations within RVM neurons in the pathophysiology of early life bladder inflammation have not been elucidated. In this study, we have identified and characterized RVM neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and colon and examined the effect of neonatal bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. A transient bladder inflammation was induced by intravesicular instillation of protamine sulfate and zymosan during postnatal days 14 through 16 (P14–16) followed by pseudorabies virus PRV-152 and PRV-614 injections into the bladder and colon, respectively, on postnatal day P60. Tissues were examined 96 h postinoculation for serotonergic, GABAergic, and enkephalinergic expressions using in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry techniques. The results revealed that &gt; 50% of RVM neurons that are synaptically connected to the bladder (i.e., PRV-152+) were GABAergic, 40% enkephalinergic, and about 14% expressing serotonergic marker tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TpH2). Neonatal cystitis resulted in a significant increase in converging neurons in RVM receiving dual synaptic inputs from the bladder and colon. In addition, neonatal cystitis significantly downregulated vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) with a concomitant increase in TpH2 expression in bladder-linked RVM neurons, suggesting an alteration in supraspinal signaling. These alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in RVM neurons may contribute to bladder pain modulation and cross-organ visceral sensitivity.</p>

     alt="Basal forebrain magnocellular cholinergic systems are damaged in mice following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia"/>
<p>Mouse cholinergic systems: Poor executive function and decreases in memory and learning are seen after neonatal HIE. We examined the cholinergic systems to determine if there is pathology there that could contribute to these functional outcomes. In contrast to normal, after neonatal HI on P10, loss of permanent attrition of ChAT neurons in the MSN, nbM, and striatum is found. ChAT+ neurons are crenated with shorter dystrophic dendrites. Increased and larger lysosomes are also present in the nbM. Within the injured ipsilateral cortex, AChE activity is abnormally increased. We hypothesize that permanent injury to the cholinergic systems after neonatal HI is responsible for these poor neurologic outcomes.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes lifelong neurologic disability. Despite the use of therapeutic hypothermia, memory deficits and executive functions remain severely affected. Cholinergic neurotransmission from the basal forebrain to neocortex and hippocampus is central to higher cortical functions. We examined the basal forebrain by light microscopy and reported loss of choline acetyltransferase-positive (ChAT)+ neurons, at postnatal day (P) 40, in the ipsilateral medial septal nucleus (MSN) after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in mice. There was no loss of ChAT+ neurons in the ipsilateral nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) and striatum. Ipsilateral striatal and nbM ChAT+ neurons were abnormal with altered immunoreactivity for ChAT, shrunken and crenated somas, and dysmorphic appearing dendrites. Using confocal images with 3D reconstruction, nbM ChAT+ dendrites in HI mice were shorter than sham (<i>p</i> = .0001). Loss of ChAT+ neurons in the MSN directly correlated with loss of ipsilateral hippocampal area. In the nbM and striatum, percentage of abnormal ChAT+ neurons correlated with loss of ipsilateral cerebral cortical and striatal area, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity increased in adjacent ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus and the increase was linearly related to loss of cortical and hippocampal area. Numbers and size of cathepsin D+ lysosomes increased in large neurons in the ipsilateral nbM. After neonatal HI, abnormalities were found throughout the major cholinergic systems in relationship to amount of forebrain area loss. There was also an upregulation of cathepsin D+ particles within the nbM. Cholinergic neuropathology may underlie the permanent dysfunction in learning, memory, and executive function after neonatal brain injury.</p>

<p>The central connections of the pallial nuclei of the adult zebrafish were examined by means of carbocyanine dye tracing, showing specialized afferent and efferent projections and indicating a modular organization for different neural processes.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied the connections (connectome) of the adult zebrafish pallium using carbocyanine dye tracing and ancillary anatomical methods. The everted zebrafish pallium (dorsal telencephalic area, D) is composed of several major zones (medial, lateral, dorsal, central, anterior, and posterior) distinguishable by their topography, cytoarchitecture, immunohistochemistry, and genoarchitecture. Our comprehensive study reveals poor interconnectivity between these pallial areas, especially between medial (Dm), lateral/dorsal (Dl, Dd), and posterior (Dp) regions. This suggests that the zebrafish pallium has dedicated modules for different neural processes. Pallial connections with extrapallial regions also show compartmental organization. Major extratelencephalic afferents come from preglomerular nuclei (to Dl, Dd, and Dm), posterior tuberal nucleus (to Dm), and lateral recess nucleus (to Dl). The subpallial (ventral, V) zones dorsal Vv, Vd, and Vs, considered homologues of the striatum, amygdala, and pallidum, are mainly afferent to Dl/Dd and Dp. Regarding the efferent pathways, they also appear characteristic of each pallial region. Rostral Dm projects to the dorsal entopeduncular nucleus. Dp is interconnected with the olfactory bulbs. The central region (Dc) defined here receives mainly projections from Dl–Dd and projects toward the pretectum and optic tectum, connections, which help to delimiting Dc. The connectome of the adult pallium revealed here complements extant studies on the neuroanatomical organization of the brain, and may be useful for neurogenetic studies performed during early stages of development. The connectome of the zebrafish pallium was also compared with the pallial connections reported in other teleosts, a large group showing high pallial diversity.</p>

     alt="Do crocodiles have a zona incerta?"/>
<p>A zona incerta is a feature common to all known mammalian brains but characters to identify it rely mainly on its location and, in particular, its relationship to the thalamic reticular nucleus. In <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, the neuronal morphology of the entopeduncular nucleus, a nucleus closely associated with but separate from the thalamic reticular nucleus complex was examined. This neuronal aggregate is suggested to be the crocodilian counterpart of the zona incerta of mammals.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In mammals, the zona incerta is thought to be involved in a number of behaviors: visceral activity, arousal, attention, and posture and locomotion. These diverse and complex features suggested that the zona incerta functions as a global or integrative node. Nevertheless, despite multiple investigations into its anatomy, physiology, and behavior in a variety of mammals, no specific character identifies the zona incerta besides its appearance in fiber-stained material and its relationship to surrounding structures. One such structure is the thalamic reticular nucleus whose caudal pole often contains some intermingled cells of the zona incerta. In crocodilians, the entopeduncular nucleus (ep) abuts the caudal pole of the thalamic reticular nucleus and displays different immunohistochemical properties and soma size when compared with neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus itself. To determine if neurons in the ep differed from those in the thalamic reticular nucleus in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, the ep was investigated using Golgi methodology. The morphology and soma size of neurons in the ep differed from those in the thalamic reticular nucleus and indicated that these two areas are indeed separate neuronal aggregates. Based on these data and the known relationships of the zona incerta to surrounding structures in mammals, the ep of crocodilians is suggested to be the counterpart of the zona incerta of mammals.</p>

<p>In the chick model, Müller glia (MG) readily reprogram into proliferating Müller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), but neuronal differentiation is limited. Isoforms of Nuclear Factor I (NFI) are cell-intrinsic factors that limit neurogenic potential.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The regenerative potential of Müller glia (MG) is extraordinary in fish, poor in chick and terrible in mammals. In the chick model, MG readily reprogram into proliferating Müller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), but neuronal differentiation is very limited. The factors that suppress the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick are slowly being revealed. Isoforms of Nuclear Factor I (NFI) are cell-intrinsic factors that limit neurogenic potential; these factors are required for the formation of MG in the developing mouse retina and deletion of these factors reprograms MG into neuron-like cells in mature mouse retina. Accordingly, we sought to characterize the patterns of expression of NFIs in the developing, mature and damaged chick retina. In addition, we characterized patterns of expression of NFIs in the retinas of large mammals, pigs and monkeys. Using a combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunolabeling, we probed for patterns of expression. In embryonic chick, levels of NFIs are very low in early E5 (embryonic day 5) retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), upregulated in E8 RPCs, further upregulated in differentiating MG at E12 and E15. NFIs are maintained in mature resting MG, microglia and neurons. Levels of NFIs are reduced in activated MG in retinas treated with NMDA and/or insulin+FGF2, and further downregulated in proliferating MGPCs. However, levels of NFIs in MGPCs were significantly higher than those seen in RPCs. Immunolabeling for NFIA and NFIB closely matched patterns of expression revealed in different types of retinal neurons and glia, consistent with findings from scRNA-seq. In addition, we find expression of NFIA and NFIB through progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone at the far periphery of the retina. We find similar patterns of expression for NFIs in scRNA-seq databases for pig and monkey retinas. Patterns of expression of NFIA and NFIB were validated with immunofluorescence in pig and monkey retinas wherein these factors were predominantly detected in MG and a few types of inner retinal neurons. In summary, NFIA and NFIB are prominently expressed in developing chick retina and by mature neurons and glia in the retinas of chicks, pigs and monkeys. Although levels of NFIs are decreased in chick, in MGPCs these levels remain higher than those seen in neurogenic RPCs. We propose that the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick retina is suppressed by NFIs.</p>

     alt="Morphological analysis of the cerebellum and its efferent system in a basal actinopterygian fish, Polypterus senegalus"/>
<p>In the present study, we revealed that the cerebellar efferent neurons in <i>Polypterus senegalus</i> are localized in restricted regions within the granular layer (i.e., mainly in the ventrolateral region of the auricula cerebelli) and have long dendrites extending within the granular layer to reach the clusters of the Purkinje cells (PCs) but not the molecular layer (ML). The morphological feature of these long extending dendrites passing through the granular layer in <i>Polypterus</i> is more similar to those of teleostean eurydendroid cells (EC) than to mammalian cerebellar efferent neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). These findings suggest that the efferent system of the <i>Polypterus</i> cerebellum has intermediate features between teleosts and amniote vertebrates.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although all vertebrate cerebella contain granule cells, Purkinje cells, and efferent neurons, the cellular arrangement and neural circuitry are highly diverse. In amniotes, cerebellar efferent neurons form clusters, deep cerebellar nuclei, lie deep in the cerebellum, and receive synaptic inputs from Purkinje cells but not granule cells. However, in the cerebellum of teleosts, the efferent neurons, called eurydendroid cells, lie near the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and receive inputs both from axons of Purkinje cells and granule cell parallel fibers. It is largely unknown how the cerebellar structure evolved in ray-finned fish (actinopterygians). To address this issue, we analyzed the cerebellum of a bichir <i>Polypterus senegalus</i>, one of the most basal actinopterygians. We found that the cell bodies of Purkinje cells are not aligned in a layer; incoming climbing fibers terminate mainly on the basal portion of Purkinje cells, revealing that the <i>Polypterus</i> cerebellum has unique features among vertebrate cerebella. Retrograde labeling and marker analyses of the efferent neurons revealed that their cell bodies lie in restricted granular areas but not as deep cerebellar nuclei in the cerebellar white matter. The efferent neurons have long dendrites like eurydendroid cells, although they do not reach the molecular layer. Our findings suggest that the efferent system of the bichir cerebellum has intermediate features between teleosts and amniote vertebrates, and provides a model to understand the basis generating diversity in actinopterygian cerebella.</p>

     alt="Retinal patterns and the cellular repertoire of neuropsin (Opn5) retinal ganglion cells"/>
<p>Using a combination of genetic reporters, viral tracing, molecular analyses, and electrophysiological profiling, this study elucidates the Neuropsin-expressing Retinal Ganglion Cell (Opn5-RGC) types of the mouse retina. These neurons are spatially nonhomogenous and stratify their dendrites in the outer sublamina of the IPL. Additionally, Opn5-RGCs are high-density, motion and edge-encoding RGC types that project to image-forming and image-stabilizing central targets in the brain. This study diversifies the potential photoreceptive compartments of the mouse eye.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obtaining a parts list of the sensory components of the retina is vital to understand the effects of light in behavior, health, and disease. Rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are the best described photoreceptors in the mammalian retina, but recent functional roles have been proposed for retinal neuropsin (Opn5)—an atypical opsin. However, little is known about the pattern of <i>Opn5</i> expression in the retina. Using cre (<i>Opn5<sup>cre</sup>
</i>) and cre-dependent reporters, we uncover patterns of <i>Opn5</i> expression and find that <i>Opn5</i> is restricted to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). <i>Opn5</i>-RGCs are nonhomogenously distributed through the retina, with greater densities of cells located in the dorsotemporal quadrant. In addition to the local topology of these cells, using cre-dependent AAV viral tracing, we surveyed their central targets and found that they are biased towards image-forming and image-stabilizing regions. Finally, molecular and electrophysiological profiling reveal that <i>Opn5</i>-RGCs comprise previously defined RGC types that respond optimally to edges and object-motion (F-mini-ONs, HD2, HD1, LEDs, ooDSRGCs, etc.). Together, these data describe the second collection of RGCs that express atypical opsins in the mouse, and expand the roles of image-forming cells in retinal physiology and function.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural analysis of the morphological phenotypes of microglia associated with neuroinflammatory cues"/>
<p>We used a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image analysis to characterize the ultrastructural morphology of human microglia under neuroinflammatory cues. The C20 human microglia cell line was stimulated by antiinflammatory (IL-4), proinflammatory (TNF-α), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cues (Aβ), and the resulting effects on microglia morphology associated with changes in microdomain (higher-order branching of processes and surface topography) were analyzed. The use of SEM enabled the characterization of microglia morphology in resolving fine details about microglia ultrastructure that were previously unappreciated.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are the primary resident immune cells of the central nervous system that are responsible for the maintenance of brain homeostasis. There is a plethora of evidence to suggest that microglia display distinct phenotypes that are associated with the alteration of cell morphology under varying environmental cues. However, it has not been fully explored how the varying states of microglial activation are linked to the alteration of microglia morphology, especially in the microdomain. The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterize the ultrastructural morphology of human microglia under neuroinflammatory cues. To address this, a human cell line of microglia was stimulated by antiinflammatory (IL-4), proinflammatory (TNF-α), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cues (Aβ, Aβ + TNF-α). The resulting effects on microglia morphology associated with changes in microdomain were analyzed using a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Our findings demonstrated that microglial activation under proinflammatory and AD-cues were closely linked to changes not only in cell shape but also in cell surface topography and higher-order branching of processes. Furthermore, our results revealed that microglia under proinflammatory cues exhibited unique morphological features involving cell-to-cell contact and the formation of vesicle-like structures. Our study provides insight into the fine details of microglia morphology associated with varying status of microglial activation.</p>

<p>Using intracellular neurobiotin injections combined with SMI-32 antibody staining, we reveal that SMI-32+ retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are distributed evenly throughout the rat retina. We compared morphological features of SMI-32+ ON cells and OFF cells in the central, middle, and peripheral retinal regions and show that cells in different regions have different characteristics. We classified SMI-32+ RGCs into five clusters based on morphological features and found that a majority of SMI-32+ RGCs belong to alpha-like cells, but a small proportion of them have small somas and small dendritic fields.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>SMI-32 is widely used to identify entire populations of alpha retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and several SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGC subsets have been studied thoroughly in rodents. However, due to the thick cover of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> neurofilaments, the morphology of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs in the central retinal region is obscured and rarely described. Moreover, SMI-32 labels more than one morphological RGC type and the full morphological characteristics and distribution of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs have yet to be discovered. Here, using intracellular neurobiotin injections combined with SMI-32 antibody staining, we investigated morphological and distributional properties of the entire SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs population in the rat retina. We found that SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs were evenly distributed throughout the rat retina. We compared the morphological features of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> ON and OFF cells in the central, middle, and peripheral retinal regions. We found that SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs in different regions have distinct characteristics, such as the soma area and the dendritic field area, and Sholl analysis of ON cells and OFF cells revealed significant differences between each region. We classified SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs into five clusters based on morphological features and found that a majority of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs belong to alpha-like cells; however, a small proportion of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs had small soma and small dendritic fields. Together, we present a full description of the morphology and distribution of SMI-32 immunoreactive RGCs in the rat retina.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endothelial cells (ECs) are key players in the development and maintenance of the vascular tree, the establishment of the blood–brain barrier and control of blood flow. Disruption in ECs is an early and active component of vascular pathogenesis. However, our ability to selectively target ECs in the CNS for identification and manipulation is limited. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we utilized a recently developed AAV-BR1 system to identify distinct classes of ECs along the vascular tree using a GFP reporter. We then developed an inducible EC-specific ectopic Connexin 43 (Cx43) expression system using AAV-BR1-CAG-DIO-Cx43-P2A-DsRed2 in combination with a mouse line carrying inducible CreERT2 in ECs. We targeted Cx43 because its loss has been implicated in microvascular impairment in numerous diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and vascular edema. GFP-labeled ECs were numerous, evenly distributed along the vascular tree and their morphology was polarized with respect to the direction of blood flow. After tamoxifen induction, ectopic Cx43 was specifically expressed in ECs. Similarly to endogenous Cx43, ectopic Cx43 was localized at the membrane contacts of ECs and it did not affect tight junction proteins. The ability to enhance gap junctions in ECs provides a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, an early pathology in numerous diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vocal learning in songbirds is mediated by cortico-basal ganglia circuits that govern diverse functions during different stages of development. We investigated developmental changes in axonal projections to and from motor cortical regions that underlie learned vocal behavior in juvenile zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>). Neurons in LMAN-core project to RA, a motor cortical region that drives vocal output; these RA-projecting neurons send a transient collateral projection to AId, a region adjacent to RA, during early vocal development. Both RA and AId project to a region of dorsal thalamus (DLM), which forms a feedback pathway to cortico-basal ganglia circuitry. These projections provide pathways conveying efference copy and a means by which information about vocal motor output could be reintegrated into cortico-basal ganglia circuitry, potentially aiding in the refinement of juvenile vocalizations during learning. We used tract-tracing techniques to label the projections of LMAN-core to AId and of RA to DLM in juvenile songbirds. The volume and density of terminal label in the LMAN-core→AId projection declined substantially during early stages of sensorimotor learning. In contrast, the RA→DLM projection showed no developmental change. The retraction of LMAN-core→AId axon collaterals indicates a loss of efference copy to AId and suggests that projections that are present only during early stages of sensorimotor learning mediate unique, temporally restricted processes of goal-directed learning. Conversely, the persistence of the RA→DLM projection may serve to convey motor information forward to the thalamus to facilitate song production during both learning and maintenance of vocalizations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pulsatile contractions and pattern formation in excitable actomyosin cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael F. Staddon, Edwin M. Munro, Shiladitya Banerjee</p>

The actin cortex is an active adaptive material, embedded with complex regulatory networks that can sense, generate, and transmit mechanical forces. The cortex exhibits a wide range of dynamic behaviours, from generating pulsatory contractions and travelling waves to forming organised structures. Despite the progress in characterising the biochemical and mechanical components of the actin cortex, the emergent dynamics of this mechanochemical system is poorly understood. Here we develop a reaction-diffusion model for the RhoA signalling network, the upstream regulator for actomyosin assembly and contractility, coupled to an active actomyosin gel, to investigate how the interplay between chemical signalling and mechanical forces regulate stresses and patterns in the cortex. We demonstrate that mechanochemical feedback in the cortex acts to destabilise homogeneous states and robustly generate pulsatile contractions. By tuning active stress in the system, we show that the cortex can generate propagating contraction pulses, form network structures, or exhibit topological turbulence.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Membrane contact probability: An essential and predictive character for the structural and functional studies of membrane proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Wang, Jiangguo Zhang, Dali Wang, Chen Song</p>

One of the unique traits of membrane proteins is that a significant fraction of their hydrophobic amino acids is exposed to the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers rather than being embedded in the protein interior, which is often not explicitly considered in the protein structure and function predictions. Here, we propose a characteristic and predictive quantity, the membrane contact probability (MCP), to describe the likelihood of the amino acids of a given sequence being in direct contact with the acyl chains of lipid molecules. We show that MCP is complementary to solvent accessibility in characterizing the outer surface of membrane proteins, and it can be predicted for any given sequence with a machine learning-based method by utilizing a training dataset extracted from MemProtMD, a database generated from molecular dynamics simulations for the membrane proteins with a known structure. As the first of many potential applications, we demonstrate that MCP can be used to systematically improve the prediction precision of the protein contact maps and structures.

                <p>by Nicolas Franco, Pietro Coletti, Lander Willem, Leonardo Angeli, Adrien Lajot, Steven Abrams, Philippe Beutels, Christel Faes, Niel Hens</p>

Several important aspects related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well known due to a lack of appropriate data. However, mathematical and computational tools can be used to extract part of this information from the available data, like some hidden age-related characteristics. In this paper, we present a method to investigate age-specific differences in transmission parameters related to susceptibility to and infectiousness upon contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. More specifically, we use panel-based social contact data from diary-based surveys conducted in Belgium combined with the next generation principle to infer the relative incidence and we compare this to real-life incidence data. Comparing these two allows for the estimation of age-specific transmission parameters. Our analysis implies the susceptibility in children to be around half of the susceptibility in adults, and even lower for very young children (preschooler). However, the probability of adults and the elderly to contract the infection is decreasing throughout the vaccination campaign, thereby modifying the picture over time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Performance of early warning signals for disease re-emergence: A case study on COVID-19 data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniele Proverbio, Françoise Kemp, Stefano Magni, Jorge Gonçalves</p>

Developing measures for rapid and early detection of disease re-emergence is important to perform science-based risk assessment of epidemic threats. In the past few years, several early warning signals (EWS) from complex systems theory have been introduced to detect impending critical transitions and extend the set of indicators. However, it is still debated whether they are generically applicable or potentially sensitive to some dynamical characteristics such as system noise and rates of approach to critical parameter values. Moreover, testing on empirical data has, so far, been limited. Hence, verifying EWS performance remains a challenge. In this study, we tackle this question by analyzing the performance of common EWS, such as increasing variance and autocorrelation, in detecting the emergence of COVID-19 outbreaks in various countries. Our work illustrates that these EWS might be successful in detecting disease emergence when some basic assumptions are satisfied: a slow forcing through the transitions and not-fat-tailed noise. In uncertain cases, we observe that noise properties or commensurable time scales may obscure the expected early warning signals. Overall, our results suggest that EWS can be useful for active monitoring of epidemic dynamics, but that their performance is sensitive to certain features of the underlying dynamics. Our findings thus pave a connection between theoretical and empirical studies, constituting a further step towards the application of EWS indicators for informing public health policies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Addressing the mean-correlation relationship in co-expression analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yi Wang, Stephanie C. Hicks, Kasper D. Hansen</p>

Estimates of correlation between pairs of genes in co-expression analysis are commonly used to construct networks among genes using gene expression data. As previously noted, the distribution of such correlations depends on the observed expression level of the involved genes, which we refer to this as a <i>mean-correlation relationship</i> in RNA-seq data, both bulk and single-cell. This dependence introduces an unwanted technical bias in co-expression analysis whereby highly expressed genes are more likely to be highly correlated. Such a relationship is not observed in protein-protein interaction data, suggesting that it is not reflecting biology. Ignoring this bias can lead to missing potentially biologically relevant pairs of genes that are lowly expressed, such as transcription factors. To address this problem, we introduce spatial quantile normalization (SpQN), a method for normalizing local distributions in a correlation matrix. We show that spatial quantile normalization removes the mean-correlation relationship and corrects the expression bias in network reconstruction.

                <p>by João Pedro Fonseca, Elham Aslankoohi, Andrew H. Ng, Michael Chevalier</p>

Beyond natural stimuli such as growth factors and stresses, the ability to experimentally modulate at will the levels or activity of specific intracellular signaling molecule(s) in specified cells within a tissue can be a powerful tool for uncovering new regulation and tissue behaviors. Here we perturb the levels of cAMP within specific cells of an epithelial monolayer to probe the time-dynamic behavior of cell-cell communication protocols implemented by the cAMP/PKA pathway and its coupling to the ERK pathway. The time-dependent ERK responses we observe in the perturbed cells for spatially uniform cAMP perturbations (all cells) can be very different from those due to spatially localized perturbations (a few cells). Through a combination of pharmacological and genetic perturbations, signal analysis, and computational modeling, we infer how intracellular regulation and regulated cell-cell coupling each impact the intracellular ERK response in single cells. Our approach reveals how a dynamic gap junction state helps sculpt the intracellular ERK response over time in locally perturbed cells.

Hedgehog (HH) signaling is important for embryonic pattering and stem cell differentiation. The G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (SMO) is the key HH signal transducer modulating both transcription-dependent and transcription-independent responses. We show that SMO protects naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from dissociation-induced cell death. We exploited this SMO dependency to perform a genetic screen in haploid ESCs where we identify the Golgi proteins TMED2 and TMED10 as factors for SMO regulation. Super-resolution microscopy shows that SMO is normally retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments, and we demonstrate that TMED2 binds to SMO, preventing localization to the plasma membrane. Mutation of TMED2 allows SMO accumulation at the plasma membrane, recapitulating early events after HH stimulation. We demonstrate the physiologic relevance of this interaction in neural differentiation, where TMED2 functions to repress HH signal strength. Identification of TMED2 as a binder and upstream regulator of SMO opens the way for unraveling the events in the ER–Golgi leading to HH signaling activation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Alzheimer's continuum is biologically defined by beta-amyloid deposition, which at the earliest stages is superimposed upon white matter degeneration in aging. However, the extent to which these co-occurring changes is characterized is relatively underexplored. The goal of this study was to use diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) and biophysical modeling to detect and describe amyloid-related white matter changes in preclinical Alzheimer disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitively unimpaired participants ages 45 to 85 years completed brain magnetic resonance imaging, amyloid positron emission tomography (florbetapir), neuropsychological testing, and other clinical measures at baseline in a cohort study. We tested whether beta-amyloid-negative (AB−) and -positive (AB+) participants differed on DKI-based conventional (ie, fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], mean kurtosis) and modeling (ie, axonal water fraction [AWF], extra-axonal radial diffusivity [<i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>]) metrics, and whether these metrics were associated with other biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found significantly greater diffusion restriction (higher FA/AWF, lower MD/<i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>) in white matter in AB+ than AB− (partial <i>η</i>
<sup>2</sup> =0.08–0.19), more notably in the extra-axonal space within primarily late myelinating tracts. Diffusion metrics predicted amyloid status incrementally over age (area under the curve = 0.84) with modest yet selective associations, where AWF (a marker of axonal density) correlated with speed/executive functions and neurodegeneration, whereas <i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub> (a marker of gliosis/myelin repair) correlated with amyloid deposition and white matter hyperintensity volume.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support prior evidence of a nonmonotonic change in diffusion behavior, where an early increase in diffusion restriction is hypothesized to reflect inflammation and myelin repair prior to an ensuing decrease in diffusion restriction, indicating glial and neuronal degeneration.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to evaluate a multicomponent health system intervention designed to reduce escalating disease-modifying treatment (DMT) expenditures and improve multiple sclerosis (MS) outcomes by increasing use of preferred formulary and highly effective DMTs (HETs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a trend study of treatment utilization and expenditure outcomes prior to (2009–2011) and during (2012–2018) MS Treatment Optimization Program (MSTOP) implementation in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) compared to a Kaiser Permanente region of similar size. Annual relapse rates (ARRs) were obtained from KPSC's electronic health records.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Adherence to preferred formulary DMTs increased from 25.4% in 2011 to 72.2% in 2017 following MSTOP implementation in KPSC and 22.1% to 43.8%, respectively, in the comparator. KPSC's annual DMT expenditures in 2018 were less than in 2011 despite an 11.3% increase in DMT-treated members. The decline in average per patient per year of treatment expenditures from a peak of $43.1 K in 2014 to $26.3 K in 2018 in KPSC was greater than the comparator, which peaked at $52.1 K and declined to $40.0 K in 2018. Over the 7 years following initiation of MSTOP, cumulative MS DMT expenditures were $161.6 million less than the comparator. HET use increased to 62.5% of per patient treatment-years versus 32.4% in the comparator. This corresponded to a 69% decline in adjusted ARR (95% confidence interval = 64.1–73.2%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) among DMT-treated patients in KPSC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A novel, expert-led health system intervention reduced MS DMT expenditures despite rising prices while simultaneously reducing MS relapse rates. Our focus on health system progress toward meaningful, measurable targets could serve as a model to improve quality and affordability of MS care in other settings. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>As SARS-CoV-2 is known to invade neural cell mitochondria, a plasma system for quantifying central nervous system proteins in living humans was used to investigate neuropathogenic mechanisms of long-COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 proteins and mitochondrial proteins (MPs) in enriched plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) and astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) were quantified in resolved acute COVID-19 without post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), PASC without neuropsychiatric manifestations (NP), PASC with NP and healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NDEV and ADEV mean levels of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were higher in all PASC sub-groups than controls, but only N levels were higher in PASC with than without NP. Exosome marker CD81-normalized NDEV mean levels of subunit 6 of MP respiratory chain complex I and subunit 10 of complex III, and neuroprotective MPs Humanin and mitochondrial open-reading frame of the 12S rRNA-c (MOTS-c) all were decreased significantly in PASC with NP but not in PASC without NP relative to controls. NDEV levels of MPs voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1) were decreased in PASC without and with NP, whereas those of calcium channel MPs mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX) and leucine zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane 1 protein (LETM1) were decreased only in PASC with NP. ADEV levels of MCU and NCLX only were increased in PASC without and with NP.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Abnormal NDEV and ADEV levels of SARS-CoV-2 N and S1 protein and MPs correlate with NP and may be biomarkers for long-COVID prognostics and therapeutic trials.</p>

                Bernacchia et al. developed a theory of sequential activity in recurrent circuits that predicted the prevalence of “spurious” sequences in cortical activity that are unrelated to sequences in the inputs and their experience-dependent erasure by Hebbian plasticity. They confirmed these predictions in visual cortical recordings.
