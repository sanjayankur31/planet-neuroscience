                Detection of sounds is a fundamental function of the auditory system. While studies of auditory cortex have gained substantial insight into detection performance using animals performing operant conditioning tasks, previous subcortical studies have mostly taken place under anesthesia, in passively listening animals, or have not measured performance at threshold. These limitations preclude direct comparisons between neuronal responses and behavior. To address this, we simultaneously measured auditory detection performance and single-unit activity in the inferior colliculus (IC) and cochlear nucleus (CN) in macaques. The spontaneous activity and response variability of CN neurons were higher than those observed for IC neurons. Signal detection theoretic methods revealed that the magnitude of responses of IC neurons provided more reliable estimates of psychometric threshold and slope compared to the responses of CN neurons. Correlations between spike count and behavioral response emerged 50-75 ms after sound onset for most IC neurons, but for fewer neurons in the CN. Electrical stimulation of the IC enhanced or degraded detection performance, depending on the response magnitude of the neurons being stimulated. These results highlight the differences between neurometric-psychometric correlations in CN and IC, and have important implications for how subcortical information could be decoded.

In mouse hairy skin, hair follicle-associated longitudinal lanceolate complexes, which are end organs comprising of LTMR axonal endings that intimately associate with terminal Schwann cell (TSC) processes, mediate LTMR responses to hair deflection and skin indentation. Here, we characterized developmental steps leading to the formation of A{beta} RA-LTMR and A{delta}-LTMR lanceolate complexes. During early postnatal development, A{beta} RA-LTMRs and A{delta}-LTMRs extend and prune cutaneous axonal branches in close association with nascent TSC processes. Netrin-G1 is expressed in these developing A{beta} RA-LTMR and A{delta}-LTMR lanceolate endings, and Ntng1 ablation experiments indicate that Netrin-G1 functions in sensory neurons to promote lanceolate ending elaboration around hair follicles. The Netrin-G ligand (NGL-1), encoded by Lrrc4c, is expressed in TSCs, and ablation of Lrrc4c phenocopies the lanceolate complex deficits observed in Ntng1 mutants. Moreover, NGL-1-Netrin-G1 signaling is a general mediator of LTMR end organ formation across diverse tissue types demonstrated by the fact that A{beta} RA-LTMR endings associated with Meissner corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles are also compromised in the Ntng1 and Lrrc4c mutant mice. Thus, axon-glia interactions mediated by NGL-1-Netrin-G1 signaling promote LTMR end organ formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differentiating Bayesian model updating and model revision based on their prediction error dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Within predictive processing learning is construed as Bayesian model updating with the degree of certainty for different existing hypotheses changing in light of new evidence. Bayesian model updating, however, cannot explain how new hypotheses are added to a model. Model revision, unlike model updating, makes structural changes to a generative model by altering its causal connections or adding or removing hypotheses. Whilst model updating and model revision have recently been formally differentiated, they have not been empirically distinguished. The aim of this research was to empirically differentiate between model updating and revision on the basis of how they affect prediction errors and predictions over time. To study this, participants took part in a within-subject computer-based learning experiment with two phases: updating and revision. In the updating phase, participants had to predict the relationship between cues and target stimuli and in the revision phase, they had to correctly predict a change in the said relationship. Based on previous research, phasic pupil dilation was taken as a proxy for prediction error. During model updating, we expected that the prediction errors over trials would be gradually decreasing as a reflection of the continuous integration of new evidence. During model revision, in contrast, prediction errors over trials were expected to show an abrupt decrease following the successful integration of a new hypothesis within the existing model. The opposite results were expected for predictions. Our results show that the learning dynamics as reflected in pupil and accuracy data are indeed qualitatively different between the revision and the updating phase, however in the opposite direction as expected. Participants were learning more gradually in the revision phase compared to the updating phase. This could imply that participants first built multiple models from scratch in the updating phase and updated them in the revision phase.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adult Camk2a gene reinstatement restores the learning and plasticity deficits of Camk2a knockout mice</a></h4>

              
                With the recent findings that mutations in the gene encoding the -subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2A) causes neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), it is of great therapeutic relevance to know if there a critical developmental time window in which CAMK2A needs to be expressed for normal brain development, or whether expression of the protein at later stages is still beneficial to restore normal functioning. To answer this question, we generated an inducible Camk2a mouse model, which allows us to express CAMK2A at any desired time. Here, we show that adult expression of CAMK2A rescues the behavioural and electrophysiological phenotypes seen in the Camk2a knock-out mice, including spatial and conditional learning and synaptic plasticity. These results suggest that CAMK2A does not play a critical irreversible role in neurodevelopment, which is of importance for future therapies to treat CAMK2A-dependent disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SOX10 Expression Levels may be a Critical Mediator of White Matter Dysfunction in Schizophrenia.</a></h4>

              
                Abnormalities of brain connectivity are consistently observed in individuals with schizophrenias (SZ). Underlying these anomalies, convergent in vivo, post-mortem, and genomic evidence suggest abnormal oligodendrocyte (OL) development and function, including lower in vivo myelination in SZ. Using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs), we previously observed a significant and substantial reduction in the number of OLs produced in cells from the SZ group compared to the healthy control (HC) group. We also observed a correlation between white matter (WM) estimated in brain in vivo and the number of OLs produced in vitro. We have now characterized potential mediators that may contribute to the SZ-associated deficit in OL production. We ran qRT-PCRs to detect group-specific differences in key myelin pathway proteins. Significant reductions of PAX6 and SOX10 expression were seen in the SZ group. We focused on SOX10 since one of its functions is the commitment of precursor cells to an oligodendrocyte fate. Using an inducible lentiviral system, we expressed SOX10 in patterned neural stem cells (NSCs) and quantified the number of OLs produced. Expression of SOX10 rescued the SZ-associated deficit in OL production, indicating that reduced SOX10 may be a critical mediator of OL dysfunction in SZ. We then ran qRT-PCRs to screen mRNAs for three proteins (SOX9, QK1 and FEZ1) whose expression was directly influenced by SOX10 or directly influenced the expression of SOX10. We saw significant reductions of SOX9 expression and a reduction in QK1 expression in the SZ group. RNAseq analysis confirmed these gene expression changes.

                This paper describes the development and testing of a brain-computer musical interface (BCMI) that allows a user to select and transform one element of a musical texture by paying attention to that particular element. In order to realize the BCMI system mentioned, a comprehensive testing scheme was established which uses auditory evoked potentials to elicit P300 waves via averaging various types of stimuli. Resented sound stimuli were divided into multi-channel speaker setups to have better localization of user-focused sound stimuli. A sound synthesis model was developed for transforming its sound texture based on neural oscillations that were categorized with the help of a self-organizing map algorithm. In addition, an artificial neural network was used to predict the possible P300 waves that show the attentional focus of a subject. Most of the P300 waves were classified successfully for most of the participants. Promising results were achieved concerning the developed BCMI system. A neural network model was also utilized to predict the possible P300 waves, which show the subject's selective attention. The majority of the participants were able to correctly classify P300 waves. The proposed BCMI system yielded promising results.

	<p>An embryo&amp;amp;rsquo;s in-utero exposure to ethanol due to a mother&amp;amp;rsquo;s alcohol drinking results in a range of deficits in the child that are collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Prenatal ethanol exposure is one of the leading causes of preventable intellectual disability. Its neurobehavioral underpinnings warrant systematic research. We investigated the immediate effects on embryos of acute prenatal ethanol exposure during gestational days (GDs) and the influence of such exposure on persistent neurobehavioral deficits in adult offspring. We administered pregnant C57BL/6J mice with ethanol (1.75 g/kg) (GDE) or saline (GDS) intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 0 h and again at 2 h intervals on GD 8 and GD 12. Subsequently, we assessed apoptosis, differentiation, and signaling events in embryo forebrains (E13.5; GD13.5). Long-lasting effects of GDE were evaluated via a behavioral test battery. We also determined the long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity-related protein expression in adult hippocampal tissue. GDE caused apoptosis, inhibited differentiation, and reduced pERK and pCREB signaling and the expression of transcription factors Pax6 and Lhx2. GDE caused persistent spatial and social investigation memory deficits compared with saline controls, regardless of sex. Interestingly, GDE adult mice exhibited enhanced repetitive and anxiety-like behavior, irrespective of sex. GDE reduced synaptic plasticity-related protein expression and caused hippocampal synaptic plasticity (LTP and LTD) deficits in adult offspring. These findings demonstrate that binge-like ethanol exposure at the GD8 and GD12 developmental stages causes defects in pERK&amp;amp;ndash;pCREB signaling and reduces the expression of Pax6 and Lhx2, leading to impaired cellular differentiation during the embryonic stage. In the adult stage, binge-like ethanol exposure caused persistent synaptic and behavioral abnormalities in adult mice. Furthermore, the findings suggest that combining ethanol exposure at two sensitive stages (GD8 and GD12) causes deficits in synaptic plasticity-associated proteins (Arc, Egr1, Fgf1, GluR1, and GluN1), leading to persistent FASD-like neurobehavioral deficits in mice.</p>

                <p>This exploratory case–control study investigates the synaptic marker beta-synuclein in serum and plasma pTau181 in adults with Down syndrome (DS) with (sDS, <i>n</i> = 14) and without (aDS, <i>n</i> = 47) clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) as well as euploid controls (<i>n</i> = 23). Beta-synuclein was higher in aDS and more pronounced in sDS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), whereas pTau181 was only higher in sDS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Both markers showed good discriminatory power (area under the curve &gt; 0.90) to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic AD. The data indicate that synaptic alterations belong to the earliest AD-associated events in DS and highlight the value of serum beta-synuclein as a potential early marker of AD.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Collier/Olf/EBF (COE) transcription factors have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature nervous system. To date, a neurological disease association has been conclusively established for only the <i>Early B-cell Factor-3</i> (<i>EBF3</i>) COE family member through the identification of heterozygous loss-of-function variants in individuals with autism spectrum/neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Here, we identify a symptom severity risk association with missense variants primarily disrupting the zinc finger domain (ZNF) in <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A phenotypic assessment of 41 individuals was combined with a literature meta-analysis for a total of 83 individuals diagnosed with <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD. Quantitative diagnostic phenotypic and symptom severity scales were developed to compare <i>EBF3</i> variant type and location to identify genotype–phenotype correlations. To stratify the effects of <i>EBF3</i> variants disrupting either the DNA-binding domain (DBD) or the ZNF, we used <i>in vivo</i> fruit fly UAS-GAL4 expression and <i>in vitro</i> luciferase assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that patient symptom severity correlates with <i>EBF3</i> missense variants perturbing the ZNF, which is a key protein domain required for stabilizing the interaction between EBF3 and the target DNA sequence. We found that ZNF-associated variants failed to restore viability in the fruit fly and impaired transcriptional activation. However, the recurrent variant EBF3 p.Arg209Trp in the DBD is capable of partially rescuing viability in the fly and preserved transcriptional activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We describe a symptom severity risk association with ZNF perturbations and EBF3 loss-of-function in the largest reported cohort to date of EBF3-related NDD patients. This analysis should have potential predictive clinical value for newly identified patients with <i>EBF3</i> gene variants. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:138–153</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association of Apolipoprotein E ɛ4 Allele with Enlarged Perivascular Spaces</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Enlarged perivascular spaces have emerged as markers of cerebral small vessel disease and are linked to perivascular drainage dysfunction. The apolipoprotein E-ɛ4 (APOE-ɛ4) allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's neuropathology, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We studied the relationship between APOE-ɛ4 and the topography and burden of enlarged perivascular spaces to elucidate underlying mechanisms between APOE-ɛ4 and adverse clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 3,564 Framingham Heart Study participants with available genotypes and magnetic resonance imaging. Enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale were rated using a validated scale. We related APOE-ɛ4 allele presence to high burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in each region and a mixed score reflecting high burden in both regions using multivariable logistic regression. Exploratory analyses incorporated presence of cerebral microbleeds and assessed effect modification by hypertension.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean age was 60.7 years (SD = 14.6), 1,644 (46.1%) were men, 1,486 (41.8%) were hypertensive, and 836 (23.5%) participants were APOE-ɛ4 carriers. APOE-ɛ4 was associated with high burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16, 1.81) and mixed regions (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.68). Associations were slightly stronger in hypertensive subjects.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The APOE-ɛ4 allele plays a modest role in the burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying small vessel disease type in community-dwelling individuals with predominant centrum semiovale enlarged perivascular spaces, which may be hypertensive angiopathy in our sample.

                <p>Ophelia syndrome or encephalitis with antibodies against the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) manifests with behavioral changes, memory deficits, and anxiety. To study the antibody pathogenicity, mice received continuous cerebroventricular infusion of patients' or controls' immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 14 days, followed by a 15-day washout. The effects on hippocampal mGluR5 clusters were determined by confocal microscopy. Animals infused with patients' IgG, but not controls' IgG, showed memory impairment, increased anxiety, and decreased neuronal surface mGluR5 clusters. After antibody clearance, both behavioral and molecular changes reversed to baseline conditions. These findings support the pathogenicity of these antibodies in anti-mGluR5 encephalitis.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Inequities in Therapy for Infantile Spasms: A Call to Action</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine whether selection of treatment for children with infantile spasms (IS) varies by race/ethnicity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The prospective US National Infantile Spasms Consortium database includes children with IS treated from 2012 to 2018. We examined the relationship between race/ethnicity and receipt of standard IS therapy (prednisolone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, vigabatrin), adjusting for demographic and clinical variables using logistic regression. Our primary outcome was <i>treatment course</i>, which considered therapy prescribed for the first and, when needed, the second IS treatment together.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 555 children, 324 (58%) were non-Hispanic white, 55 (10%) non-Hispanic Black, 24 (4%) non-Hispanic Asian, 80 (14%) Hispanic, and 72 (13%) other/unknown. Most (398, 72%) received a standard treatment course. Insurance type, geographic location, history of prematurity, prior seizures, developmental delay or regression, abnormal head circumference, hypsarrhythmia, and IS etiologies were associated with standard therapy. In adjusted models, non-Hispanic Black children had lower odds of receiving a standard treatment course compared with non-Hispanic white children (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20–0.89; <i>p</i> = 0.02). Adjusted models also showed that children with public (vs. private) insurance had lower odds of receiving standard therapy for treatment 1 (OR, 0.42; CI, 0.21–0.84; <i>p</i> = 0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Non-Hispanic Black children were more often treated with non-standard IS therapies than non-Hispanic white children. Likewise, children with public (vs. private) insurance were less likely to receive standard therapies. Investigating drivers of inequities, and understanding the impact of racism on treatment decisions, are critical next steps to improve care for patients with IS.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Heterozygous PNPT1 Variants Cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 25</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are characterized by genetic heterogeneity. Some mapped and named <i>loci</i> remain without a causal gene identified. Here we applied next generation sequencing (NGS) to uncover the genetic etiology of the <i>SCA25 locus</i>.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing were performed in families linked to <i>SCA25</i>, including the French family in which the <i>SCA25 locus</i> was originally mapped. Whole exome sequence data were interrogated in a cohort of 796 ataxia patients of unknown etiology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SCA25 phenotype spans a slowly evolving sensory and cerebellar ataxia, in most cases attributed to ganglionopathy. A pathogenic variant causing exon skipping was identified in the gene encoding Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase PNPase 1 (<i>PNPT1)</i> located in the <i>SCA25</i> linkage interval. A second splice variant in <i>PNPT1</i> was detected in a large Australian family with a dominant ataxia also mapping to <i>SCA25</i>. An additional nonsense variant was detected in an unrelated individual with ataxia. Both nonsense and splice heterozygous variants result in premature stop codons, all located in the S1-domain of PNPase. In addition, an elevated type I interferon response was observed in blood from all affected heterozygous carriers tested. PNPase notably prevents the abnormal accumulation of double-stranded mtRNAs in the mitochondria and leakage into the cytoplasm, associated with triggering a type I interferon response.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identifies <i>PNPT1</i> as a new SCA gene, responsible for SCA25, and highlights biological links between alterations of mtRNA trafficking, interferonopathies and ataxia. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:122–137</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The Optimal Target and Connectivity for Deep Brain Stimulation in Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can reduce seizures in Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS). However, little is known about the optimal target and whether efficacy depends on connectivity of the stimulation site. Using outcome data from the ESTEL trial, we aimed to determine the optimal target and connectivity for DBS in LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 20 patients underwent bilateral DBS of the thalamic centromedian nucleus (CM). Outcome was percentage seizure reduction from baseline after 3 months of DBS, defined using three measures (monthly seizure diaries, 24-hour scalp electroencephalography [EEG], and a novel diary-EEG composite). Probabilistic stimulation mapping identified thalamic locations associated with higher/lower efficacy. Two substitute diffusion MRI datasets (a normative dataset from healthy subjects and a “disease-matched” dataset from a separate group of LGS patients) were used to calculate structural connectivity between DBS sites and a map of areas known to express epileptic activity in LGS, derived from our previous EEG-fMRI research.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Results were similar across the three outcome measures. Stimulation was most efficacious in the anterior and inferolateral “parvocellular” CM border, extending into the ventral lateral nucleus (posterior subdivision). There was a positive association between diary-EEG composite seizure reduction and connectivity to areas of <i>a priori</i> EEG-fMRI activation, including premotor and prefrontal cortex, putamen, and pontine brainstem. In contrast, outcomes were not associated with baseline clinical variables.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Efficacious CM-DBS for LGS is linked to stimulation of the parvocellular CM and the adjacent ventral lateral nucleus, and is associated with connectivity to, and thus likely modulation of, the “secondary epileptic network” underlying the shared electroclinical manifestations of LGS.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to identify predictors in common between different clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing predictive models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 704 patients from our center seen at MS onset, measuring 37 baseline demographic, clinical, treatment, and MRI predictors, and 10-year outcomes. Our primary aim was identifying predictors in common among clinical outcomes: aggressive MS, benign MS, and secondary-progressive (SP)MS. We also investigated MRI outcomes: T2 lesion volume (T2LV) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). The performance of the full 37-predictor model was compared with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-selected model of predictors in common between each outcome by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The full 37-predictor model was highly predictive of clinical outcomes: in-sample AUC was 0.91 for aggressive MS, 0.81 for benign MS, and 0.81 for SPMS. After variable selection, 10 LASSO-selected predictors were in common between each clinical outcome: age, Expanded Disability Status Scale, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory and bowel/bladder signs, timed 25-foot walk ≥6 seconds, poor attack recovery, no sensory attacks, and time-to-treatment. This reduced model had comparable cross-validation AUC as the full 37-predictor model: 0.84 versus 0.81 for aggressive MS, 0.75 versus 0.73 for benign MS, and 0.76 versus 0.75 for SPMS, respectively. In contrast, 10-year MRI outcomes were more strongly influenced by initial T2LV and BPF than clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Early prognostication of MS is possible using LASSO modeling to identify a limited set of accessible clinical features. These predictive models can be clinically usable in treatment decision making once implemented into web-based calculators. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:87–96</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The motor severity in Parkinson disease (PD) is believed to parallel dopaminergic terminal degeneration in the striatum, although the terminal was reported to be virtually absent by 4 years postdiagnosis. Meanwhile, neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra (SN) elucidated a variability at early stages and gradual loss with less variability 10 years postdiagnosis. Here, we aimed to clarify the correlation between motor impairments and striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration and nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss at early to advanced stages of PD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ninety-three PD patients were divided into early and advanced subgroups based on motor symptom duration and whether motor fluctuation was present. Striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration was evaluated using a presynaptic dopamine transporter tracer, <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron density was assessed by neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In patients with early stage PD (motor symptoms for ≤8 or 10 years), motor dysfunction during the drug-off state was paralleled by a decline in <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum despite the absence of a correlation with reductions in NM-MRI signals in SN. Meanwhile, in patients with advanced stage PD (motor symptoms for &gt;8 or 10 years and with fluctuation), the degree of motor deficits during the drug-off state was not correlated with <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum, despite its significant negative correlation with NM-MRI signals in SN.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose striatal dopaminergic terminal loss measured using <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT and nigral dopamine neuron loss assessed with NM-MRI as early stage and advanced stage motor impairment biomarkers, respectively. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:110–121</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Effect of Imaging Markers on Reperfusion Therapy in Basilar Artery Occlusion</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of endovascular therapy (EVT) versus intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO), based on the information of advanced imaging.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data of stroke patients with radiologically confirmed BAO within 24 hours. BAO subjects were categorized into “top-of-the-basilar” syndrome (TOBS) and other types. An initial infarct size of &lt;70ml and a ratio of ischemic tissue to infarct volume of ≥1.8 was defined as “target mismatch.” The primary outcome was a good outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3 at 3 months. Propensity score adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity score methods were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 474 BAO patients, 93 (19.6%) were treated with IVT prior to EVT, 91 (19.2%) were treated with IVT alone, 95 (20.0%) were treated with EVT alone, and 195 (41.1%) were treated with antithrombotic therapy. In IPTW analyses, we found no benefit of EVT over IVT for good outcome in either TOBS patients (odds ratio = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88–1.31) or those with other types (odds ratio = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.94–1.36). However, in patients with other types, if there existed a target mismatch, EVT was independently related to good outcome (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.17–1.81).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The “target mismatch profile” seems to be a possible candidate selection standard of EVT for those with other types of BAO. Future studies should separate TOBS from other types of BAO, and try to use advanced imaging. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:97–106</p>

                <p>Nodding syndrome (NS) is a poorly understood form of childhood-onset epilepsy that is characterized by the pathognomonic ictal phenomenon of repetitive vertical head drops. To evaluate the underlying ictal neurophysiology, ictal EEG features were evaluated in nine participants with confirmed NS from South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda and ictal presence of high frequency gamma oscillations on scalp EEG were assessed. Ictal EEG during the head nodding episode predominantly showed generalized slow waves or sharp-and-slow wave complexes followed by electrodecrement. Augmentation of gamma activity (30–70 Hz) was seen during the head nodding episode in all the participants. We confirm that head nodding episodes in persons with NS from the three geographically distinct regions in sub-Saharan Africa share the common features of slow waves with electrodecrement and superimposed gamma activity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Menopause Status Moderates Sex Differences in Tau Burden: A Framingham PET Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Women have a higher lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men. Among cognitively normal (CN) older adults, women exhibit elevated tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal compared with men. We explored whether menopause exacerbates sex differences in tau deposition in middle-aged adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>328 CN participants from the Framingham Study (mean age = 57 years (±10 years), 161 women, of whom, 104 were post-menopausal) underwent tau and β-amyloid (Aβ)-PET neuroimaging. We examined global Aβ-PET, and tau-PET signal in 5 regions identified <i>a priori</i> as demonstrating significant sex differences in older adults (in temporal, inferior parietal, middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions). We examined sex and menopause status-related differences in each region-of-interest, using linear regressions, as well as interactions with Aβ and APOEε4 genotype.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Women exhibited higher tau-PET signal (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.002), and global Aβ-PET (<i>p</i> = 0.010), than men in inferior parietal, rostral middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions. Compared with age-matched men, post-menopausal women showed significantly higher tau-PET signal in parieto-occipital regions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). By contrast, no differences in tau-PET signal existed between pre-menopausal women and men. Aβ-PET was not associated with menopausal status or age. Neither Aβ-PET nor APOEε4 status moderated sex or menopause associations with tau-PET.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Clear divergence in tauopathy between the sexes are apparent approximately 20 years earlier than previously reported. Menopause status moderated sex differences in Aβ and tau-PET burden, with tau first appearing post-menopause. Sex and menopause differences consistently appeared in middle frontal and parieto-occipital regions but were not moderated by Aβ burden or APOEε4, suggesting that menopause-related tau vulnerability may be independent of AD-related pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A Role for Insulin‐like Growth Factor 1 in the Generation of Epileptic Spasms in a murine model</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Infantile spasms are associated with a wide variety of clinical conditions, including perinatal brain injuries. We have created a model in which prolonged infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) into the neocortex, beginning in infancy, produces a localized lesion and reproduces the behavioral spasms, electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, and drug responsiveness seen clinically. Here, we undertook experiments to explore the possibility that the growth factor IGF-1 plays a role in generating epileptic spasms.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We combined long-term video EEG recordings with quantitative immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses to unravel IGF-1's role in spasm generation. Immunohistochemistry was undertaken in surgically resected tissue from infantile spasms patients. We used viral injections in neonatal conditional IGF-1R knock-out mice to show that an IGF-1-derived tripeptide (1-3)IGF-1, acts through the IGF-1 receptor to abolish spasms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Immunohistochemical methods revealed widespread loss of IGF-1 from cortical neurons, but an increase in IGF-1 in the reactive astrocytes in the TTX-induced lesion. Very similar changes were observed in the neocortex from patients with spasms. In animals, we observed reduced signaling through the IGF-1 growth pathways in areas remote from the lesion. To show the reduction in IGF-1 expression plays a role in spasm generation, epileptic rats were treated with (1-3)IGF-1. We provide 3 lines of evidence that (1-3)IGF-1 activates the IGF-1 signaling pathway by acting through the receptor for IGF-1. Treatment with (1-3)IGF-1 abolished spasms and hypsarrhythmia-like activity in the majority of animals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Results implicate IGF-1 in the pathogenesis of infantile spasms and IGF-1 analogues as potential novel therapies for this neurodevelopmental disorder. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:45–60</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Orchestrated neuronal migration and cortical folding: A computational and experimental study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shuolun Wang, Kengo Saito, Hiroshi Kawasaki, Maria A. Holland</p>

Brain development involves precisely orchestrated genetic, biochemical, and mechanical events. At the cellular level, neuronal proliferation in the innermost zone of the brain followed by migration towards the outermost layer results in a rapid increase in brain surface area, outpacing the volumetric growth of the brain, and forming the highly folded cortex. This work aims to provide mechanistic insights into the process of brain development and cortical folding using a biomechanical model that couples cell division and migration with volumetric growth. Unlike phenomenological growth models, our model tracks the spatio-temporal development of cohorts of neurons born at different times, with each cohort modeled separately as an advection-diffusion process and the total cell density determining the extent of volume growth. We numerically implement our model in Abaqus/Standard (2020) by writing user-defined element (UEL) subroutines. For model calibration, we apply <i>in utero</i> electroporation (IUE) to ferret brains to visualize and track cohorts of neurons born at different stages of embryonic development. Our calibrated simulations of cortical folding align qualitatively with the ferret experiments. We have made our experimental data and finite-element implementation available online to offer other researchers a modeling platform for future study of neurological disorders associated with atypical neurodevelopment and cortical malformations.

When we plan for long-range goals, proximal information cannot be exploited in a blindly myopic way, as relevant future information must also be considered. But when a subgoal must be resolved first, irrelevant future information should not interfere with the processing of more proximal, subgoal-relevant information. We explore the idea that decision making in both situations relies on the flexible modulation of the degree to which different pieces of information under consideration are weighted, rather than explicitly decomposing a problem into smaller parts and solving each part independently. We asked participants to find the shortest goal-reaching paths in mazes and modeled their initial path choices as a noisy, weighted information integration process. In a base task where choosing the optimal initial path required weighting starting-point and goal-proximal factors equally, participants did take both constraints into account, with participants who made more accurate choices tending to exhibit more balanced weighting. The base task was then embedded as an initial subtask in a larger maze, where the same two factors constrained the optimal path to a subgoal, and the final goal position was irrelevant to the initial path choice. In this more complex task, participants’ choices reflected predominant consideration of the subgoal-relevant constraints, but also some influence of the initially-irrelevant final goal. More accurate participants placed much less weight on the optimality-irrelevant goal and again tended to weight the two initially-relevant constraints more equally. These findings suggest that humans may rely on a graded, task-sensitive weighting of multiple constraints to generate approximately optimal decision outcomes in both hierarchical and non-hierarchical goal-directed tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Prediction and expression analysis of deleterious nonsynonymous SNPs of Arabidopsis ACD11 gene by combining computational algorithms and molecular docking approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mahmudul Hasan Rifat, Jamil Ahmed, Milad Ahmed, Foeaz Ahmed, Airin Gulshan, Mahmudul Hasan</p>

Accelerated cell death 11 (ACD11) is an autoimmune gene that suppresses pathogen infection in plants by preventing plant cells from becoming infected by any pathogen. This gene is widely known for growth inhibition, premature leaf chlorosis, and defense-related programmed cell death (PCD) in seedlings before flowering in <i>Arabidopsis</i> plant. Specific amino acid changes in the ACD11 protein’s highly conserved domains are linked to autoimmune symptoms including constitutive defensive responses and necrosis without pathogen awareness. The molecular aspect of the aberrant activity of the ACD11 protein is difficult to ascertain. The purpose of our study was to find the most deleterious mutation position in the ACD11 protein and correlate them with their abnormal expression pattern. Using several computational methods, we discovered PCD vulnerable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACD11. We analysed the RNA-Seq data, identified the detrimental nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNP), built genetically mutated protein structures and used molecular docking to assess the impact of mutation. Our results demonstrated that the A15T and A39D mutations in the GLTP domain were likely to be extremely detrimental mutations that inhibit the expression of the ACD11 protein domain by destabilizing its composition, as well as disrupt its catalytic effectiveness. When compared to the A15T mutant, the A39D mutant was more likely to destabilize the protein structure. In conclusion, these mutants can aid in the better understanding of the vast pool of PCD susceptibilities connected to ACD11 gene GLTP domain activation.

Understanding tropical biology is important for solving complex problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and zoonotic pandemics, but biology curricula view research mostly via a temperate-zone lens. Integrating tropical research into biology education is urgently needed to tackle these issues.

Tropical biology is currently largely absent from undergraduate curricula. The integration of authentic research in tropical biology could promote internationality among scientists and provide experiential learning that enables students to address complex global problems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The connecting cilium inner scaffold provides a structural foundation that protects against retinal degeneration</a></h4>

Inherited retinal degeneration due to loss of photoreceptor cells is a leading cause of human blindness. These cells possess a photosensitive outer segment linked to the cell body through the connecting cilium (CC). While structural defects of the CC have been associated with retinal degeneration, its nanoscale molecular composition, assembly, and function are barely known. Here, using expansion microscopy and electron microscopy, we reveal the molecular architecture of the CC and demonstrate that microtubules are linked together by a CC inner scaffold containing POC5, CENTRIN, and FAM161A. Dissecting CC inner scaffold assembly during photoreceptor development in mouse revealed that it acts as a structural zipper, progressively bridging microtubule doublets and straightening the CC. Furthermore, we show that <i>Fam161a</i> disruption in mouse leads to specific CC inner scaffold loss and triggers microtubule doublet spreading, prior to outer segment collapse and photoreceptor degeneration, suggesting a molecular mechanism for a subtype of retinitis pigmentosa.

                Background: The sudden massive spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a major public health emergency and changed the scene of the health care globally. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most dental treatment procedures were considered as major sources of infection transmission. Thus, the current survey aimed at evaluating knowledge, awareness and attitude of dental professional of India towards teledentistry. Methods: A pre structured questionnaire was framed and distributed among 600 dental professionals of India using email, WhatsApp and other social media modes.  SPSS version 17 was used for data analysis. The Chi-Square, student t test and one way ANOVA test were applied to assess the association between qualification, type of practice and participant response.  Logistic regression analysis was also carried out. Results: In total, 431 dental professionals completed the survey. Overall, 94.7% of dental professionals were aware about teledentistry and agreed it is useful in fulfilling needs of the community at great amount. A statistically significant difference was found for questions related to the application of teledentistry for all branches, whether it is a good tool to assess oral hygiene in remote areas and its usefulness in training in primary health care centre when comparison was done among dental professionals and specialist in different branches of dentistry. Conclusions: Within the limits of the study, findings show that study participants exhibited good knowledge and awareness regarding teledentistry. The participants exhibited positive attitude towards teledentistry but at the same time expressed the uncertainty in challenges which they may face in teledentistry. Lack of training, advanced infrastructure, good connectivity and network are main issues they were concerned about. The other important point of concern is many participants felt teledentistry cannot be applied for all branches of dentistry. Future research should focus on this aspect of teledentistry.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perception of health care students towards lectures as a teaching and learning method in the COVID era - A multicentric cross-sectional study from India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The sudden precipitation of the pandemic forced undergraduates to take refuge at home, deserting the campus. Consequently, the age-old classroom in person teaching-learning (T-L) method shifted and lessons had to be conducted online. In previous decades, archetypical classroom lectures survived a lot of criticism in the face of the quasi-passive nature of T-L  methodology. There are very few studies that reflect undergraduate students' perceptions of lectures. This study aimed to evaluate undergraduate students’ perceptions of lectures using an online questionnaire with 13 items, which was circulated to undergraduate students of medical, physiotherapy, and nursing courses in three settings at different locations of private and public health schools. There was a total of 877 responses. The surveyed students were in favor of lectures and considered them indispensable for undergraduate learning. They preferred it as a kind of organized learning through the teacher’s own experiences. Our study suggests that it is not the ‘lecture’ that requires mending but possibly teachers require better training, application of effective audio-visual aids, and innovative techniques to sustain students' interest in the class.

                Background: The purpose of this work is to study the prospects of using charity lotteries as a marketing tool for involving consumers and employees in charitable activities. Methods: The research methodology is based on the principles of the theory of planned behavior by Ajzen. Results: The study confirmed that behavioral intention is correlated with actual behavior. Subjective norms factors have the most significant influence on behavioral intention. Conclusions: Correlation analysis allowed us to establish a weak effect of socio-demographic characteristics (Age, Gender, Capital Status, Ownership of Home, Educational Qualification, Employment, Annual Income) on behavior. The experience of participating in the lottery in the past also turned out to be insignificant. There is reason to believe that Russian consumers' decision to participate in the charity lottery is impulsive or due to pressure from their surroundings.

                Background: Pleiotropic actions of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the brain are context- and cell-dependent, but whether this holds for their receptors (insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), respectively), is less clear. Methods: We compared mice lacking IR or IGF-IR in glial fibrillary astrocytic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes in a tamoxifen-regulated manner, to clarify their role in this type of glial cells, as the majority of data of their actions in brain have been obtained in neurons. Results: We observed that mice lacking IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP IR KO mice) develop mood disturbances and maintained intact cognition, while at the same time show greater pathology when cross-bred with APP/PS1 mice, a model of familial Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Conversely, mice lacking IGF-IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP-IGF-IR KO mice) show cognitive disturbances, maintained mood tone, and show control-dependent changes in AD-like pathology. Conclusions: These observations confirm that the role of IR and IGF-IR in the brain is cell-specific and context-dependent.

                Background To fostering organizational improvement, the performance must be assessed. In the context of university-industry collaboration (UIC) in the technology transfer process, the performance of also must be assessed. However, the performance covers complex aspects which makes it difficult to be measured. This indicates the need to have a better understanding of the methods used. Therefore, this study presents a systematic literature review on the performance measurement of UIC in the technology transfer process that can give to the researchers an easy and quick overview of the literature about (mainly) the methods used for the performance measurement. Methods We used two major scientific databases, i.e., Scopus and Web of Science. We defined four groups of keywords to restrict the search criteria. We only consider articles published in the last decade, during 2010 to November 2021. The search procedure contains four phases following the PRISMA framework: (i) identification, (ii) screening, (iii) eligibility, and (iv) inclusion. Results The final screening process resulted in 24 articles that satisfied the criteria for inclusion in this review. The collected articles are categorized according to two classifications. The first is about type of the collaboration, while the second is about the methods used. We investigated three types of collaboration, i.e., at the level of technology transfer office (TTO), the academic (university) spin-offs, and joint-research. There are several methods for assessing performance, ranging from qualitative, quantitative, to mixed methods. Conclusion The literature review leads us to the following conclusions. First, most studies are conducted at the TTO level, in which it is anticipated since it is the most common form UIC. Second, the application of data envelopment analysis is still preferable than other method in measuring the performance. This study also provides possible research directions that can facilitate scholars to uncover gaps in the literature.

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Biotechnology ethics for food and agriculture</a></h4>

              
                In January, the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Law (NBFDL) went into effect, requiring all US food manufacturers to disclose whether their products contain bioengineered ingredients (1). However, the law is the subject of debate, with critics arguing that it inhibits rather than increases transparency around the use of biotechnology in food (2). Given the importance of the agbiotech industry, the Biden-Harris administration should develop an agricultural biotechnology advisory commission devoted to inclusive deliberation on ethics and governance in agricultural and food biotechnology.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glycine encephalopathy, also known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), is an inherited neurometabolic disorder with variable clinical course and severity, ranging from infantile epileptic encephalopathy to psychiatric disorders. A precise phenotypic characterization and an evaluation of predictive approaches are needed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Longitudinal clinical and biochemical data of 25 individuals with NKH from the patient registry of the International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders were studied with in silico analyses, pathogenicity scores, and molecular modeling of <i>GLDC</i> and <i>AMT</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Symptom onset (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and diagnosis occur earlier in life in severe NKH (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Presenting symptoms affect the age at diagnosis. Psychiatric problems occur predominantly in attenuated NKH. Onset age ≥ 3 months (66% specificity, 100% sensitivity, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma glycine ratio ≤ 0.09 (57% specificity, 100% sensitivity, AUC = 0.88) are sensitive indicators for attenuated NKH, whereas CSF glycine concentration ≥ 116.5μmol/l (100% specificity, 93% sensitivity, AUC = 0.97) and CSF/plasma glycine ratio ≥ 0.15 (100% specificity, 64% sensitivity, AUC = 0.88) are specific for severe forms. A ratio threshold of 0.128 discriminates the overlapping range. We present 10 new <i>GLDC</i> variants. Two mild variants resulted in attenuated, whereas 2 severe variants or 1 mild and 1 severe variant led to severe phenotype. Based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic parameters, we propose a severity prediction model.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study widens the phenotypic spectrum of attenuated NKH and expands the number of pathogenic variants. The multiparametric approach provides a promising tool to predict disease severity, helping to improve clinical management strategies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Background: Recent study suggests that obesity is associated with a broad executive function decline. Several dietary intervention studies may improve executive function domains. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the effect of dietary modification on executive function domains in adult patients with obesity. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane Library, Science Direct/SCOPUS, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to obtain articles until April 30th, 2022. The main outcome of interest was the change in executive function domains (inhibition, cognitive flexibility, working memory, verbal fluency, decision making, and planning). We extracted data on the standardized mean difference (SMD) between the dietary intervention and control groups in change from baseline executive function domains. The meta-analysis with a random effect model was performed using STATA, and the Risk of Bias (RoB 2.0) tool was used to determine the quality of the included studies. Subsequently, to assess the quality of evidence, we used GRADE tools. Results: A total of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met the objectives were obtained. This meta-analysis showed that dietary modification improved cognitive flexibility [SMD=0.303 (-0.527 to -0.079), P=0.008, I2= 0%], working memory [SMD=0.601 (0.076 to 1.125), P=0.025, I2=83.6%], and verbal fluency [(SMD=0.223 (0.002 to 0.428), P=0.033, I2=16.3%]. However, most RCTs (six out of 10) had some concerns due to allocation concealment, unclear blinding assessment or participants, and a high dropout rate. Thus, further well-controlled RCTs are needed to confirm these results. Conclusions: Dietary modification might improve executive function domains in adult individuals with overweight/obesity. Registration: This systematic review is registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022332572; registered 24 May 2022).

                In a recent study, Farrelly, Zheng, and colleagues used a histone proteomics approach and patient-derived neurons to show increase in histone variant H2A.Z acetylation associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). They identified the bromo- and extraterminal (BET) protein BRD4 as an H2A.Z acetylation ‘reader’, and showed that a BRD4 inhibitor ameliorated the SCZ-associated transcriptional signature, revealing a new candidate target for treatment.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 16 June 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01110-9">doi:10.1038/s41593-022-01110-9</a></p>Can studying individual differences in brain structure and function reveal individual differences in behavior? Analyses of MRI data from nearly 50,000 individuals may suggest that the possibility is fleeting. Although sample size is important for brain-based prediction, researchers can take other steps to build better biomarkers. These include testing model generalizability across people, datasets, and time points and maximizing model robustness by optimizing brain data acquisition, behavioral measures, and prediction approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selfee, self-supervised features extraction of animal behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Fast and accurately characterizing animal behaviors is crucial for neuroscience research. Deep learning models are efficiently used in laboratories for behavior analysis. However, it has not been achieved to use an end-to-end unsupervised neural network to extract comprehensive and discriminative features directly from social behavior video frames for annotation and analysis purposes. Here, we report a self-supervised feature extraction (Selfee) convolutional neural network with multiple downstream applications to process video frames of animal behavior in an end-to-end way. Visualization and classification of the extracted features (Meta-representations) validate that Selfee processes animal behaviors in a way similar to human perception. We demonstrate that Meta-representations can be efficiently used to detect anomalous behaviors that are indiscernible to human observation and hint in-depth analysis. Furthermore, time-series analyses of Meta-representations reveal the temporal dynamics of animal behaviors. In conclusion, we present a self-supervised learning approach to extract comprehensive and discriminative features directly from raw video recordings of animal behaviors and demonstrate its potential usage for various downstream applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamics of allosteric regulation of the phospholipase C-γ isozymes upon recruitment to membranes</a></h4>

              
                Numerous receptor tyrosine kinases and immune receptors activate phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) isozymes at membranes to control diverse cellular processes including phagocytosis, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The molecular details of this process are not well understood. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we show that PLC-γ1 is relatively inert to lipid vesicles that contain its substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), unless first bound to the kinase domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1). Exchange occurs throughout PLC-γ1 and is exaggerated in PLC-γ1 containing an oncogenic substitution (D1165H) that allosterically activates the lipase. These data support a model whereby initial complex formation shifts the conformational equilibrium of PLC-γ1 to favor activation. This receptor-induced priming of PLC-γ1 also explains the capacity of a kinase-inactive fragment of FGFR1 to modestly enhance the lipase activity of PLC-γ1 operating on lipid vesicles but not a soluble analog of PIP<sub>2</sub> and highlights potential cooperativity between receptor engagement and membrane proximity. Priming is expected to be greatly enhanced for receptors embedded in membranes and nearly universal for the myriad of receptors and co-receptors that bind the PLC-γ isozymes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of Synaptotagmin-SNARE-complexin complexes bridging a vesicle and a flat lipid bilayer</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic vesicles are primed into a state that is ready for fast neurotransmitter release upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to Synaptotagmin-1. This state likely includes trans-SNARE complexes between the vesicle and plasma membranes that are bound to Synaptotagmin-1 and complexins. However, the nature of this state and the steps leading to membrane fusion are unclear, in part because of the difficulty of studying this dynamic process experimentally. To shed light into these questions, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of systems containing trans-SNARE complexes between two flat bilayers or a vesicle and a flat bilayer with or without fragments of Synaptotagmin-1 and/or complexin-1. Our results need to be interpreted with caution because of the limited simulation times and the absence of key components, but suggest mechanistic features that may control release and help visualize potential states of the primed Synaptotagmin-1-SNARE-complexin-1 complex. The simulations suggest that SNAREs alone induce formation of extended membrane-membrane contact interfaces that may fuse slowly, and that the primed state contains macromolecular assemblies of trans-SNARE complexes bound to the Synaptotagmin-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain and complexin-1 in a spring-loaded configuration that prevents premature membrane merger and formation of extended interfaces, but keeps the system ready for fast fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Self-organization of in vitro neuronal assemblies drives to complex network topology</a></h4>

              
                Activity-dependent self-organization plays an important role in the formation of specific and stereotyped connectivity patterns in neural circuits. By combining neuronal cultures, and tools with approaches from network neuroscience and information theory, we can study how complex network topology emerges from local neuronal interactions. We constructed effective connectivity networks using a transfer entropy analysis of spike trains recorded from rat embryo dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures between 6 and 35 days in vitro to investigate how the topology evolves during maturation. The methodology for constructing the networks considered the synapse delay and addressed the influence of firing rate and population bursts as well as spurious effects on the inference of connections. We found that the number of links in the networks grew over the course of development, shifting from a segregated to a more integrated architecture. As part of this progression, three significant aspects of complex network topology emerged. In agreement with previous in silico and in vitro studies, a small-world architecture was detected, largely due to strong clustering among neurons. Additionally, the networks developed in a modular topology, with most modules comprising nearby neurons. Finally, highly active neurons acquired topological characteristics that made them important nodes to the network and integrators of modules. These findings leverage new insights into how neuronal effective network topology relates to neuronal assembly self-organization mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct representation of cue-outcome association by D1 and D2 neurons in the ventral striatum’s olfactory tubercle</a></h4>

              
                Positive and negative associations acquired through olfactory experience are thought to be especially strong and long-lasting. The conserved direct olfactory sensory input to the ventral striatal olfactory tubercle (OT) and its convergence with dense dopaminergic input to the OT could underlie this privileged form of associative memory, but how this process occurs is not well understood. We imaged the activity of the two canonical types of striatal neurons, expressing D1- or D2-type dopamine receptors, in the OT at cellular resolution while mice learned odor-outcome associations ranging from aversive to rewarding. D1 and D2 neurons both responded to rewarding and aversive odors. D1 neurons in the OT robustly and bidirectionally represented odor valence, responding similarly to odors predicting similar outcomes regardless of odor identity. This valence representation persisted even in the absence of a licking response to the odors and in the absence of the outcomes, indicating a true transformation of odor sensory information by D1 OT neurons. In contrast, D2 neuronal representation of the odor-outcome associations was weaker, contingent on a licking response by the mouse, and D2 neurons were more selective for odor identity than valence. Stimulus valence coding in the OT was modality-sensitive, with separate sets of D1 neurons responding to odors and sounds predicting the same outcomes, suggesting that integration of multimodal valence information happens downstream of the OT. Our results point to distinct representation of identity and valence of odor stimuli by D1 and D2 neurons in the OT.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiple timescales of sensory-evidence accumulation across the dorsal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical areas seem to form a hierarchy of intrinsic timescales, but the relevance of this organization for cognitive behavior remains unknown. In particular, decisions requiring the gradual accrual of sensory evidence over time recruit widespread areas across this hierarchy. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this recruitment is related to the intrinsic integration timescales of these widespread areas. We trained mice to accumulate evidence over seconds while navigating in virtual reality and optogenetically silenced the activity of many cortical areas during different brief trial epochs. We found that the inactivation of all tested areas affected the evidence-accumulation computation. Specifically, we observed distinct changes in the weighting of sensory evidence occurring during and before silencing, such that frontal inactivations led to stronger deficits on long timescales than posterior cortical ones. Inactivation of a subset of frontal areas also led to moderate effects on behavioral processes beyond evidence accumulation. Moreover, large-scale cortical Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity during task performance displayed different temporal integration windows. Our findings suggest that the intrinsic timescale hierarchy of distributed cortical areas is an important component of evidence-accumulation mechanisms.

                Animals can evolve dramatic sensory functions in response to environmental constraints, but little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these changes. The Mexican tetra, <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i>, is a leading model to study genetic, behavioral, and physiological evolution by comparing eyed surface populations and blind cave populations. We compared neurophysiological responses of posterior lateral line afferent neurons and motor neurons across <i>A. mexicanus</i> populations to reveal how shifts in sensory function may shape behavioral diversity. These studies indicate differences in intrinsic afferent signaling and gain control across populations. Elevated endogenous afferent activity identified a lower response threshold in the lateral line of blind cavefish relative to surface fish leading to increased evoked potentials during hair cell deflection in cavefish.. We next measured the effect of inhibitory corollary discharges from hindbrain efferent neurons onto afferents during locomotion. We discovered that three independently-derived cavefish populations have evolved persistent afferent activity during locomotion, suggesting for the first time that partial loss of function in the efferent system can be an evolutionary mechanism for neural adaptation of a vertebrate sensory system.

                CRISPR technology has made generation of gene knock-outs widely achievable in cells. However, once inactivated, their re-activation remains difficult, especially in diploid cells. Here, we present DExCon (<span class="underline">D</span>oxycycline-mediated endogenous gene <span class="underline">Ex</span>pression <span class="underline">Con</span>trol), DExogron (DExCon combined with auxin-mediated targeted protein degradation), and LUXon (light responsive DExCon) approaches which combine one-step CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeted knockin of fluorescent proteins with an advanced Tet-inducible TRE3GS promoter. These approaches combine blockade of active gene expression with the ability to re-activate expression on demand, including activation of silenced genes. Systematic control can be exerted using doxycycline or spatiotemporally by light, and we demonstrate functional knock-out/rescue in the closely related Rab11 family of vesicle trafficking regulators. Fluorescent protein knock-in results in bright signals compatible with low-light live microscopy from monoallelic modification, the potential to simultaneously image different alleles of the same gene, and bypasses the need to work with clones. Protein levels are easily tunable to correspond with endogenous expression through cell sorting (DExCon), timing of light illumination (LUXon), or by exposing cells to different levels of auxin (DExogron). Furthermore, our approach allowed us to quantify previously unforeseen differences in vesicle dynamics, transferrin receptor recycling, expression kinetics, and protein stability among highly similar endogenous Rab11 family members and their colocalization in triple knock-in ovarian cancer cell lines.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The relationship between response dynamics and the formation of confidence varies across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Accurate metacognitive judgements, such as forming a confidence judgement, are crucial for goal-directed behaviour but decline with older age. Besides changes in the sensory processing of stimulus features, there might also be changes in the motoric aspects of giving responses that account for age-related changes in confidence. In order to assess the association between confidence and response parameters across the adult lifespan, we measured response times and peak forces in a four-choice flanker task with subsequent confidence judgements. In 65 healthy adults from 20 to 76 years of age, we showed divergent associations of each measure with confidence, depending on decision accuracy. Participants indicated higher confidence after faster responses in correct but not incorrect trials. They also indicated higher confidence after less forceful responses in errors but not in correct trials. Notably, these associations were age-dependent as the relationship between confidence and response time was more pronounced in older participants, while the relationship between confidence and response force decayed with age. Our results add to the notion that confidence is related to response parameters and demonstrate noteworthy changes in the observed associations across the adult lifespan. These changes potentially constitute an expression of general age-related deficits in performance monitoring or, alternatively, index a failing mechanism in the computation of confidence in older adults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cold stimulation without touch: a method for perceptual and neurophysiological studies of thermal processing and multimodal interactions</a></h4>

              
                Background: Thermal and tactile stimuli are transduced by different receptor classes. However, mechano- and thermo-sensitive afferents interact at spinal and supraspinal levels. Yet, most cold stimulation studies are confounded by mechanical contact, making these interactions difficult to isolate. Methods for precise control of purely thermal stimulations remain challenging, particularly in the cold range. New Method: We developed a flexible, multi-purpose, non-tactile, focal, temperature-controlled cold stimulator. This method controls the exposure of a target skin region to a dry-ice source. Using a thermal camera to monitor skin temperature, and adjusting the source-skin distance accordingly, we could deliver non-tactile cold stimuli with customisable profiles, for studying different aspects of thermal sensation. Results: To validate our method, we measured absolute and relative thresholds for cold sensation without mechanical contact in 13 human volunteer participants, using the method of limits. We found that the absolute cold detection threshold was 32.71oC +- 0.88 oC. This corresponded to a threshold relative to each participants baseline skin temperature of -1.08 oC +- 0.37 oC. Comparisons with Existing Method: Our method allows controllable cold stimulation without the confound of mechanical contact, in a controllable and focal manner, for the first time. Conclusions: We report a non-contact cold thermal stimulator and accompanying control system. We used this to measure a pure cold threshold, in the absence of confounding touch. Our method enables more targeted studies of both cold sensory pathways, and of cold-touch interactions.

                The brain evolved to govern behavior in a dynamic world, in which pertinent information about choices is often in flux. Thus, the commitment to an action choice must reflect a balance between monitoring that information and the necessity to act before opportunities are lost. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of dynamic decision-making in humans using low dimensional space representation of brain wide magnetoencephalography recordings. We show that the principal components (PCs) of alpha (9-13 Hz) and beta power (16-24 Hz) are involved in tracking sensory information evolving over time in the sensorimotor and visual cortex. We also found that alpha PCs reflect the commitment to a particular choice, while beta PCs reflect motor execution. Finally, higher frequency components in subcortical areas reflect the adjustment of speed-accuracy tradeoff policies. These results provide a new detailed characterization of the distributed oscillatory brain processes underlying dynamic decision-making in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural responses to instructed positive couple interaction: An fMRI study on compliment sharing</a></h4>

              
                Love is probably the most fascinating feeling that a person ever experiences. However, little is known about what is happening in the brains of a romantic couple - the central and most salient relationship during adult age - while they are particularly tender and exchanging loving words with one another. To gain insight into nearly natural couple interaction, we collected data from N = 84 individuals (after including N = 43 heterosexual romantic couples) simultaneously in two functional magnetic resonance imaging scanners, while they sent and received compliments, i.e. short messages about what they liked about each other and their relationship. Activation patterns during compliment sharing in the individuals revealed a broad pattern of activated brain areas known to be involved in empathy and reward processing. Notably, the ventral striatum, including parts of the putamen, was activated particularly when selecting messages for the partner. This indicates that the anticipation of a beloved person's positive reaction is rewarding already. Therefore, we provide initial evidence that the neural systems underlying giving a verbal treat to a romantic partner seem to involve dopaminergic basal ganglia. These results can have important implications for the neurobiological mechanisms protecting and stabilizing romantic relationships, which build a highly relevant aspect of human life and health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gray matter cortical thickness predicts individual pain sensitivity: a multi-center machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                Pain sensitivity is known to considerably vary across individuals. While the variability in pain has been linked to structural neural correlates, it is still unclear how well these findings replicate in independent data and whether they are powerful enough to provide reliable pain sensitivity predictions on the individual level. In this study, we constructed a predictive model of pain sensitivity utilising structural MRI-based cortical thickness data from a multi-center dataset (3 centers, 131 healthy participants). Cross-validated estimates revealed a statistically significant and clinically relevant predictive performance (Pearson-r = 0.36, p < 0.0005). The predictions were found to be specific to pain sensitivity and not biased towards potential confounding effects (e.g., anxiety, stress, depression, center-effects). Analysis of model coefficients suggests that the most robust cortical thickness predictors of pain sensitivity are the right rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus and left temporal pole. Cortical thickness in these regions was negatively correlated to pain sensitivity. Our results can be considered as a proof-of-concept for the capacity of brain morphology to predict pain sensitivity, paving the way towards future multimodal brain-based biomarkers of pain. Key words: predictive modelling, machine learning, gray matter, cortical thickness, pain sensitivity, rACC, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal pole, QST, pain thresholds, LASSO

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Towards A More Informative Representation of the Fetal-Neonatal Brain Connectome using Variational Autoencoder</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have helped elucidate previously inaccessible trajectories of early-life prenatal and neonatal brain development. To date, the interpretation of fetal-neonatal fMRI data has relied on linear analytic models, akin to adult neuroimaging data. However, unlike the adult brain, the fetal and newborn brain develops extraordinarily rapidly, far outpacing any other brain development period across the lifespan. Consequently, conventional linear computational models may not adequately capture these accelerated and complex neurodevelopmental trajectories during this critical period of brain development along the prenatal-neonatal continuum. To obtain a nuanced understanding of fetal-neonatal brain development, including non-linear growth, for the first time, we developed quantitative, systems-wide representations of neuronal circuitry in a large sample (>700) of fetuses, preterm, and full-term neonates using an unsupervised deep generative model called Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a model previously shown to be superior to linear models in representing complex resting state data in healthy adults. Here, we demonstrated that non-linear brain features, i.e., latent variables, derived with the VAE, carried important individual neural signatures, leading to improved representation of prenatal-neonatal brain maturational patterns and more accurate and stable age prediction compared to linear models. Using the VAE decoder, we also revealed distinct functional brain networks spanning the sensory and default mode networks. Using the VAE, we are able to reliably capture and quantify complex, non-linear fetal-neonatal functional neural connectivity. This will lay the critical foundation for detailed mapping of healthy and aberrant functional brain signatures that have their origins in fetal life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG Network Classification of Alzheimer's disease: Comparison of Functional Connectivity Methods</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia in the world. AD disrupts neuronal pathways and thus is commonly viewed as a network disorder. Many studies demonstrate the power of functional connectivity (FC) graph-based biomarkers for automated diagnosis of AD using electroencephalography (EEG). However, various FC measures are commonly utilised as each aims to quantify an unique aspect of brain coupling. Graph neural networks (GNN) provide a powerful framework for learning on graphs. While there is a growing number of studies using GNN to classify EEG brain graphs, it is unclear which method should be utilised to estimate the brain graph. We use eight FC measures to estimate FC brain graphs from sensor-level EEG signals. GNN models are trained in order to compare the performance of the selected FC measures. Additionally, three baseline models based on literature are trained for comparison. We show that GNN models perform significantly better than the other baseline models. Moreover, using FC measures to estimate brain graphs improves the performance of GNN compared to models trained using a fixed graph based on the spatial distance between the EEG sensors. However, no FC measure performs consistently better than the other measures. The best GNN reaches 0.984 area under sensitivity-specificity curve (AUC) and 92% accuracy whereas the best baseline model, a convolutional neural network, has 0.924 AUC and 84.7% accuracy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparison between an exact and a heuristic neural mass model with second order synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neural mass models (NMMs) are designed to reproduce the collective dynamics of neuronal populations. A common framework for NMMs assumes heuristically that the output firing rate of a neural population can be described by a static nonlinear transfer function (NMM1). However, a recent exact mean-field theory for quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons challenges this view by showing that the mean firing rate is not a static function of the neuronal state but follows two coupled nonlinear differential equations (NMM2). Here we analyze and compare these two descriptions in the presence of second-order synaptic dynamics. First, we derive the mathematical equivalence between the two models in the infinitely slow synapse limit, i.e., we show that NMM1 is an approximation of NMM2 in this regime. Next, we evaluate the applicability of this limit in the context of realistic physiological parameter values by analyzing the dynamics of models with inhibitory or excitatory synapses. We show that NMM1 fails to reproduce important dynamical features of the exact model, such as the self-sustained oscillations of an inhibitory interneuron QIF network. Furthermore, in the exact model but not in the limit one, stimulation of a pyramidal cell population induces resonant oscillatory activity whose peak frequency and amplitude increase with the self-coupling gain and the external excitatory input. This may play a role in the enhanced response of densely connected networks to weak uniform inputs, such as the electric fields produced by non-invasive brain stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subventricular zone cytogenesis provides trophic support for neural repair</a></h4>

              
                Stroke enhances proliferation of neural precursor cells within the subventricular zone (SVZ) and induces ectopic migration of newborn cells towards the site of injury. Here we characterize the identity of cells arising from the SVZ after stroke and provide insight into their function by uncovering a mechanism through which they facilitate neural repair and functional recovery. Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that SVZ-derived cells that migrate towards stroke induced cortical lesions in mice are predominantly undifferentiated precursors, suggesting that the main function of post-injury cytogenesis is not cell replacement. We find that SVZ-derived cells are a unique cellular source of trophic factors that instruct neural repair. Chemogenetic ablation of neural precursor cells or conditional knockout of VEGF in the adult neural stem cell lineage impairs neuronal and vascular reparative responses and worsens functional recovery after stroke. In addition, normal aging markedly diminishes the cytogenic response to stroke, resulting in worse functional recovery. Therapeutic replacement of VEGF in peri-infarct cortex is sufficient to induce neural repair and functional recovery in mice with arrested cytogenesis. These findings indicate that the SVZ cytogenic response following brain injury is a source of trophic support that drives neural repair and recovery.

                The enteric nervous system (ENS), sometimes considered as a "second brain" due to its large autonomy from central circuits, is made up of interconnected plexuses organized in a mesh-like network lining the gastrointestinal tract. Originally described as a leading actor of the regulation of digestion, bowel advance and intestinal secretion, its implication in various neuropathologies has recently been demonstrated. However, with only a few exceptions, its morphology and pathologic alterations have been studied on thin sections of the intestinal wall or in dissected explants. Due to its intricate morphology, precious information on its three-dimensional (3-D) architecture and connectivity is often lost. In this context, we have developed a fast, label-free 3-D imaging method of the ENS, based on intrinsic signals of the tissue. We used a custom, fast tissue-clearing protocol based on a high refractive-index aqueous solution, and then characterized the autofluorescence signals arising from the various cellular and sub-cellular components of the ENS. Validation by immunofluorescence and spectral recordings complete our label-free characterization. Finally, we demonstrate the fast acquisition of detailed 3-D image stacks from unlabeled mouse intestine, across the whole intestinal wall and including both the myenteric and submucosal enteric nervous plexuses using a new spinning-disk two-photon microscope. The combination of fast clearing (less than 15 min for 73 % transparency), autofluorescence detection and rapid volumetric imaging (less than a minute for the acquisition of s z-stack of 100 planes (150*150 microns) at 300-nm spatial resolution) paves the way for new applications in fundamental and clinical research.

                Due to its high temporal resolution and non-invasive nature, electroencephalography (EEG) is considered a method of great value for the field of auditory cognitive neuroscience. In performing source space analyses, localization accuracy poses a bottleneck, which precise forward models based on individualized attributes such as subject anatomy or electrode locations aim to overcome. Yet acquiring anatomical images or localizing EEG electrodes requires significant additional funds and processing time, making it an oftentimes inaccessible asset. Neuroscientific software offers template solutions, on which analyses can be based. For localizing the source of auditory evoked responses, we here compared the results of employing such template anatomies and electrode positions versus the subject-specific ones, as well as combinations of the two. All considered cases represented approaches commonly used in electrophysiological studies. We considered differences between two commonly used inverse solutions (dSPM, sLORETA) and targeted the primary auditory cortex; a notoriously small cortical region that is located within the lateral sulcus, thus more prone to errors in localization. Through systematical comparison of the outcomes in terms of auditory activity attributes and leakage quantification, we assessed how the individualization steps impacted the analyses outcomes. Both electrode locations as well as subject anatomies were found to have an effect, which though varied based on the configuration considered. When comparing the inverse solutions, we moreover found that dSPM more consistently benefited from individualization of subject characteristics. Based on the scientific question considered, our results may be used to facilitate the planning of auditory neuroscientific experiments in terms of expected infrastructure, personnel and funds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter microstructure in face and body networks predicts facial expression and body posture perception across development</a></h4>

              
                Facial expression and body posture recognition have protracted developmental trajectories. Interactions between face and body perception, such as the influence of body posture on facial expression perception, also change with development. While the brain regions underpinning face and body processing are well-defined, little is known about how white-matter tracts linking these regions relate to perceptual development. Here, we obtained complementary diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures (fractional anisotropy FA, spherical mean S), and a quantitative MRI myelin-proxy measure (R1), within white-matter tracts of face- and body-selective networks in children and adolescents and related these to perceptual development. In tracts linking occipital and fusiform face areas, facial expression perception was predicted by age-related microstructural development, as measured by S and R1, as well as age-independent individual differences in microstructure, as measured by FA. Tract microstructure linking the body region in posterior superior temporal sulcus with anterior temporal lobe (ATL) was related to the influence of body on facial expression perception, supporting ATL as a site of face and body network convergence. Overall, our results highlight age-dependent and age-independent constraints that white-matter microstructure poses on perceptual abilities during development and the importance of complementary microstructural measures in linking brain structure and behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Caecal dysfunction in the NL3R451C mouse model of autism</a></h4>

              
                The mouse caecum is a pouch-like structure that is anatomically similar to the human appendix and is hypothesised to serve as a reservoir for commensal bacteria. The gastrointestinal tract is also home to the largest immunological organ of the body and the enteric nervous system (ENS), which regulates gut motility and secretion. The caecum is therefore an ideal location to study neuro-immune-microbe interactions in gut-brain communication. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; autism) frequently present with gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to core diagnostic behavioural features, implying a gut-brain link. More broadly, changes in gut-brain connectivity are now thought to play a critical role in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we employed a mouse model of autism expressing a missense mutation in the neuroligin-3 post-synaptic protein (NL3R451C) that affects brain and enteric neuronal activity. We previously observed abnormal caecal ENS architecture and immune cell morphology in the caecal patch in this model, however it is unknown if caecal function is altered in NL3R451C mice. Using a tri-cannulation approach to record motility patterns in the mouse caecum, we identified caecal motor complexes in ex vivo preparations. Caecal permeability and neurally-evoked secretion levels were also studied. Key immune populations including gut macrophages and dendritic cells within the caecal patch were also stained using immunofluorescence to investigate shifts in immune activity. Caecal motility patterns in NL3R451C mice differed from wildtype littermates. Specifically, caecal motor complexes occurred at a higher frequency and for a shorter duration in NL3R451C mice than in wildtype littermates. In NL3R451C mice, neurally-evoked caecal secretion was reduced in response to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist (DMPP), but permeability was unchanged. Increased numbers of caecal patches were observed in NL3R451C mice compared to wildtype, but the morphology of examined immune populations were unchanged. Future research is warranted to better understand caecal function and how neuro-immune interactions in the caecum affect health and neurodevelopmental disorders via the gut-brain axis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A model for generating differences in microtubules between axonal branches depending on the distance from terminals</a></h4>

              
                In the remodeling of axonal arbor, the growth and retraction of branches are differentially regulated within a single axon. Although cell-autonomously generated differences in microtubule (MT) turnover are thought to be involved in selective branch regulation, the cellular system whereby neurons generate differences of MTs between axonal branches has not been clarified. Because MT turnover tends to be slower in longer branches compared with neighboring shorter branches, feedback regulation depending on branch length is thought to be involved. In the present study, we generated a model of MT lifetime in axonal terminal branches by adapting a length-dependent model in which parameters for MT dynamics were constant in the arbor. The model predicted that differences in MT lifetime between neighboring branches could be generated depending on the distance from terminals. In addition, the following points were predicted. Firstly, destabilization of MTs throughout the arbor decreased the differences in MT lifetime between branches. Secondly, differences of MT lifetime existed even before MTs entered the branch point. In axonal MTs in primary neurons, treatment with a low concentration of nocodazole significantly decreased the differences of detyrosination (deTyr) and tyrosination (Tyr) of tubulins, indicators of MT turnover. Expansion microscopy of the axonal shaft before the branch point revealed differences in deTyr/Tyr modification on MTs. Our model recapitulates the differences in MT turnover between branches and provides a feedback mechanism for MT regulation that depends on the axonal arbor geometry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epac2 in midbrain dopamine neurons contributes to cocaine reinforcement via facilitation of dopamine release</a></h4>

              
                Chronic exposure to drugs of abuse results in an upregulation of cAMP signaling in the mesolimbic dopamine system, a molecular adaptation thought to be critically involved in the development of drug dependence. Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac2) is a major cAMP effector abundantly expressed in the brain. However, it remains unknown whether Epac2 contributes to cocaine reinforcement. Here, we report that Epac2 in the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes cocaine reinforcement via facilitation of dopamine release. Conditional knockout of Epac2 from midbrain dopamine neurons (Epac2-cKO) and the selective Epac2 inhibitor ESI-05 decreased cocaine self-administration in mice under both fixed-ratio and progressive-ratio reinforcement schedules and across a broad range of cocaine doses. In addition, Epac2 in midbrain dopamine neurons robustly facilitated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in vitro and in vivo. This mechanism is central to the behavioral effects of Epac2 disruption, as chemogenetic activation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons increased dopamine release and reversed the impairment of cocaine self-administration in Epac2-cKO mice. Conversely, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons reduced dopamine release and cocaine self-administration in wild-type mice. Epac2-mediated facilitation of dopamine release may therefore represent a novel and powerful mechanism that contributes to cocaine reinforcement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anticipatory influences on simple sensory-motor behaviors are encoded by rapidly fluctuating neural dynamics across the human brain</a></h4>

              
                A major challenge in understanding how expectations guide sensory-motor behavior has been to relate relatively simple algorithmic explanations to their potentially complex neural substrates. We studied this relationship using intracranial recordings from 23 patients with medically refractory epilepsy performing a simple visual-detection task with variable foreperiod delay. We identified two distinct anticipatory influences on behavior by fitting an abstract motor-preparatory model ("rise-to-bound") to response times (RTs). The first "predictive" process increased reaction speed and premature responses prior to stimulus arrival ("false alarms"), whereas the second "reactive" process increased reaction speed without affecting false alarms. We linked these anticipatory processes to rapidly fluctuating neural-activity patterns across the brain by leveraging the high spatio-temporal resolution and broad coverage of intracranial recordings. Predictive and reactive signals were highly distributed and interspersed throughout the brain but distinguished by their timing (e.g., occurring around response and stimulus onset, respectively), anatomical distribution (e.g., greater representations in MTL and perirolandic areas, respectively), and modulation patterns (e.g., decreased and increased activity during periods of higher expectation, respectively). These results provide new insights into the complex, but identifiable, mappings between specific, behaviorally derived forms of anticipatory information processing and the widespread neural dynamics that implement them.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing the diversity of L2/3 human neocortical neurons in epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                In the current study, we performed whole-cell current clamp recordings from human cortical neurons in layer 2/3 of the human neocortex in order to characterize the diversity of L2/3 human neocortical neurons in epileptic foci with various etiologies in order to begin to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of hyperexcitability which are still mostly unknown. We differentiated neuronal subtypes based on their firing patterns and AHP kinetics or epilepsy subtype (malformation of cortical development (MCD) vs. other (non-MCD)). We found that L2/3 pyramidal neurons have diverse firing properties and action potential kinetics, with some neurons looking remarkably similar to LTS interneurons. We also saw that L2/3 pyramidal neurons could be split into those with fast AHPs and those without, medium AHPs (mAHPs). Based on these parameters, we were unable to significantly differentiate neurons based on firing properties indicating that AHP component kinetics alone do not dictate L2/3 pyramidal neuron firing in human epileptic cortical slices. We also report significant differences in intrinsic properties between MCD and non-MCD and control L2/3 pyramidal neurons and are the first to characterize that wash on of the proconvulsant drug, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), leads to increased AP duration, less firing rate (FR) accommodation, and slowed down AHPs. Overall, the present study is the first to characterize the large variability of L2/3 human neocortical pyramidal neurons, to compare between L2/3 pyramidal neurons within the epileptic foci between MCD and non-MCD cases, to use control tissue from tumor patients without incidence of seizure, and to determine the influence of 4-AP on L2/3 pyramidal neuron intrinsic properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Do training with blurred images make convolutional neural networks closer to humans concerning object recognition performance and internal representations?</a></h4>

              
                It is suggested that experiences of perceiving blurry images in addition to sharp images contribute to the development of robust human visual processing. To computationally investigate the effect of exposure to blurry images, we trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on ImageNet object recognition with a variety of combinations of sharp and blurry images. In agreement with related studies, mixed training on sharp and blurred images (B+S) makes the CNNs close to humans with respect to robust object recognition against a change in image blur. B+S training also reduces the texture bias of CNN in recognition of shape-texture-cue-conflict images, but the effect is not strong enough to achieve a strong shape bias comparable to what humans show. Other tests also suggest that B+S training is not sufficient to produce robust human-like object recognition based on global configurational features. We also show using representational similarity analysis and zero-shot transfer learning that B+S-Net does not acquire blur-robust object recognition through separate specialized sub-networks, each for sharp and blurry images, but through a single network analyzing common image features. However, blur training alone does not automatically create a mechanism like the human brain where subband information is integrated into a common representation. Our analyses suggest that experience with blurred images helps the human brain develop neural networks that robustly recognize the surrounding world, but it is not powerful enough to fill a large gap between humans and CNNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Laminar Distribution of stimulus- and task-related variables related to auditory streaming in core and belt auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Humans and non-human animals parse the auditory scene into distinct auditory objects or "streams" by grouping together stimuli with common features and segregating those with different features. This process is commonly called "auditory scene analysis". Although previous studies have identified neural mechanisms in the primary (core) auditory cortex that may underlie auditory-stream segregation, we do not have a good understanding of the contribution of cortical regions outside of the core auditory cortex to stream segregation nor do we understand the laminar specificity of these contributions. To examine these issues, we recorded translaminar multiunit activity (MUA) from the core and belt auditory cortex in macaque monkeys while they participated in an auditory streaming task designed to provide an objective measure of auditory-stream segregation. We found that MUA encoded both the stimulus variables and the monkey's behavioral choices related to our streaming task. Overall, core MUA was modulated more by the stimulus variables and the monkey's choices than belt MUA. However, whereas neural correlates of these variables were uniformly distributed in the core auditory cortex, stimulus- and choice-related information was predominantly represented in the superficial and deep layers of belt, respectively. These findings support a differential representation of stimulus- and choice-related variables related to auditory scene analysis along the primate auditory cortical pathway.

                Entorhinal grid cells implement a spatial code with hexagonal periodicity, signaling the position of the animal within an environment. Grid maps of cells belonging to the same module share spacing and orientation, only differing in relative two-dimensional spatial phase, which could result from their participation in a two-dimensional attractor. Such an architecture, however, has the drawbacks of being complex to construct and rigid, allowing no degrees of freedom for grid cells to deviate from the hexagonal pattern, as happens under a variety of experimental manipulations. Here we show that a simpler one-dimensional architecture is enough to align grid cells equally well. Using topological data analysis, we show that the resulting population activity is a sample of a torus, while the ensemble of maps preserves features of the network architecture. The flexibility of this low dimensional attractor allows it to negotiate with the feedforward inputs the geometry of the representation manifold, rather than imposing it, finding a number of equally viable configurations. Our results represent a proof of principle against the intuition that the architecture and the representation manifold of an attractor are the same topological object, with implications to the study of attractor networks across the brain.

                The relation between the processing of space and time in the brain has been an enduring cross-disciplinary question. Grid cells have been recognized as a hallmark of the mammalian navigation system, with recent studies attesting to their involvement in organization of conceptual knowledge in humans. To determine whether grid-cell-like representations support temporal processing, we asked subjects to mentally simulate changes in age and time-of-day, each constituting a trajectory in an age-day space, while undergoing fMRI. We found that grid-cell-like representations supported trajecting across this age-day space. Furthermore, brain regions concurrently coding past-to-future orientation positively modulated the magnitude of grid-cell-like representation in the left entorhinal cortex. Our findings suggest that temporal processing may be supported by spatially modulated systems, and that innate regularities of abstract domains may interface and alter grid-cell-like representations, similarly to spatial geometry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dose-dependent suppression of hippocampal contextual memory formation, place cells, and spatial engrams by the NMDAR antagonist (R)-CPP</a></h4>

              
                A common way to study the functional importance of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in hippocampal memory-encoding circuits is by administering NMDAR antagonists. We recently compared the effects of (R,S)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), a competitive NMDAR antagonist, on suppression of memory in vivo versus suppression of NMDAR-mediated field EPSPs (fEPSPNMDA) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in vitro. Surprisingly, we found that concentrations that block contextual conditioning in vivo are ineffective at blocking the fEPSPNMDA or LTP in vitro. Here we tested one possible explanation for the mismatch--that the hippocampus is relatively resistant to CPP compared to other brain structures engaged in contextual fear conditioning. We used the context pre-exposure facilitation effect (CPFE) paradigm to isolate the hippocampal component of contextual learning, and in-vivo calcium imaging of place cells and spatial engrams to directly assess hippocampal spatial coding. We found that, by both measures, the active enantiomer (R)-CPP did interfere with hippocampal function at concentrations below those that block fEPSPs or LTP. We conclude that the alternative--that CPP interferes with memory by targeting NMDARs in interneurons rather than pyramidal neurons--is the more likely explanation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal dynamics of cholinergic activity in the septo-hippocampal system</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic projection neurons in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca are the major source of cholinergic modulation of hippocampal circuit functions that support neural coding of location and running speed. Changes in cholinergic modulation are known to correlate with changes in brain states, cognitive functions, and behavior. However, whether cholinergic modulation can change fast enough to serve as a potential speed signal in hippocampal and parahippocampal cortices and whether the temporal dynamics in such a signal depend on the presence of visual cues remain unknown. In this study, we use a fiber-photometric approach to quantify the temporal dynamics of cholinergic activity in freely moving mice as a function of the animal's running speed and visual cues. We show that the population activity of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca changes fast enough to be aligned well with changes in the animal's running speed and is strongly and linearly correlated to the logarithm of the animal's running speed. Intriguingly, the cholinergic modulation remains strongly and linearly correlated to the speed of the animal's neck movements during periods of stationary activity. Furthermore, we show that cholinergic modulation is unaltered during darkness. Lastly, we identify rearing, a discrete behavior where the mouse stands on its hindlimbs to scan the environment from an elevated perspective, is associated with higher cholinergic activity than expected from neck movements on the horizontal plane alone. Taken together, these data show that temporal dynamics in the cholinergic modulation of hippocampal circuits are fast enough to provide a potential running speed signal in real-time. Moreover, the data show that cholinergic modulation is primarily a function of the logarithm of the animal's movement speed, both during locomotion and during stationary activity, with no significant interaction with visual inputs. These data advance our understanding of temporal dynamics in cholinergic modulation of hippocampal circuits and their functions in the context of neural coding of location and running speed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endocytic trafficking determines cellular tolerance of presynaptic opioid signaling</a></h4>

              
                Opioid tolerance is well described physiologically but its mechanistic basis remains incompletely understood. An important site of opioid action in vivo is the presynaptic terminal, where opioids inhibit transmitter release. This response characteristically resists desensitization over minutes yet becomes gradually tolerant over hours, and how this is possible remains unknown. Here we delineate a cellular mechanism underlying this longer-term form of opioid tolerance. Our results support a model in which presynaptic tolerance is mediated by a gradual depletion of cognate receptors from the axon surface through iterative rounds of receptor endocytosis and recycling. For the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), we show that the agonist-induced endocytic process which initiates iterative receptor cycling requires GRK2/3-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor cytoplasmic tail, and that partial or biased agonist drugs which have reduced ability to drive phosphorylation-dependent endocytosis in terminals produce correspondingly less presynaptic tolerance. We then show that the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) conforms to the same general paradigm except that endocytosis of DOR from the presynapse, in marked contrast to MOR, does not require phosphorylation of the receptor cytoplasmic tail. Further, we show that DOR recycles less efficiently than MOR in axons and, consistent with this, that DOR tolerance develops more strongly. Together, these results delineate a cellular basis for the development of presynaptic tolerance to opioids and describe a methodology useful for investigating presynaptic neuromodulation more broadly.

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a complex and progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and postural instability. Furthermore, PD is associated with a wide spectrum of non-motor symptoms that add to overall disability. In recent years, some investigations, from basic science to clinical applications, have focused on the role of vitamin D in PD, often with controversial findings. Vitamin D has widespread effects on several biological processes in the central nervous system, including neurotransmission in dopaminergic neural circuits. Various studies have recorded lower levels of vitamin D in PD patients than in healthy controls. Low vitamin D status has also been correlated with the risk for PD and motor severity, whereas less is known about the effects vitamin D has on cognitive function and other non-motor symptoms. This review aims to better characterize the correlation between vitamin D and PD, clarify the role of vitamin D in PD prevention and treatment, and discuss avenues for future research in this field.</p>

	<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a group of conditions associated with the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and characterized by somatic and neuropsychological alterations. On the other hand, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by a multifaceted neurobehavioral syndrome. Since alcohol can affect every stage of brain development, some authors hypothesized that in utero alcohol exposure might be linked to an increased risk of ASD in subjects with genetic vulnerability. The present review aimed to summarize the available literature on the possible association between FASD and ASD, also focusing on the reported clinical overlaps and on the possible shared pathogenic mechanisms. Studies in this field have stressed similarities and differences between the two conditions, leading to controversial results. The available literature also highlighted that both the disorders are often misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, stressing the need to broaden the perspective, paying specific attention to milder presentations and sub-syndromic traits.</p>

	<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid (RNA) at higher levels than in plasma has been observed in HIV-1-positive patients and defined as CSF/plasma discordance or CSF escape. Discordance is particularly seen in untreated patients with antiretroviral agents. Quantitative data regarding its association with blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) damage and intracranial co-infection with other pathogens are limited. Therefore, we used the CSF to plasma HIV-1 RNA ratio (HRR) to determine its relation to central nervous system (CNS) co-infection in HIV-1-positive treatment-na&amp;amp;iuml;ve individuals. We retrospectively recruited the subjects with HIV-1-positive and potential neurological deficits. A lumbar puncture was performed before the antiretroviral therapy. The paired CSF/plasma HIV-1 RNA samples were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models and multiple spine regression analyses were performed to assess the association between the HRR and CNS co-infection. A total of 195 patients with 78% males (median age: 49 years) were included in this study, of whom 98 (50.2%) had CNS co-infection with other pathogens. The receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cutoff value for the HRR to predict the CNS co-infection was 1.00. Higher HRR (&amp;amp;ge;1) was significantly associated with tuberculous meningitis (OR 6.50, 95% CI 2.08&amp;amp;ndash;20.25, p = 0.001), cryptococcus meningitis (OR 7.58, 95% CI 2.10&amp;amp;ndash;27.32, p = 0.001), and multiple co-infection (OR 4.04, 95% CI 1.02&amp;amp;ndash;16.04, p = 0.047). Higher HRR (&amp;amp;ge;1) (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.09&amp;amp;ndash;8.73, p = 0.032) was independently associated with the CNS co-infection after adjusting for covariates. No significant nonlinear association was found between the HRR and CNS co-infection in the multivariate spline regression (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05) and a positive relationship was found between the HRR and CNS co-infection when the HRR was &amp;amp;ge;0.78. Higher HRR was associated with an increased risk of CNS co-infection in HIV-1-positive patients. The relationship between the HRR and CNS co-infection may be related to the BBB disturbance and warrants further investigation with a large, longitudinal cohort.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Uncertainty Unveils the Distinct Role of Haptic Cues in Multisensory Grasping</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human multisensory grasping movements (i.e., seeing and feeling a handheld object while grasping it with the contralateral hand) are superior to movements guided by each separate modality. This multisensory advantage might be driven by the integration of vision with either the haptic position only or with both position and size cues. To contrast these two hypotheses, we manipulated visual uncertainty (central vs peripheral vision) and the availability of haptic cues during multisensory grasping. We showed a multisensory benefit regardless of the degree of visual uncertainty suggesting that the integration process involved in multisensory grasping can be flexibly modulated by the contribution of each modality. Increasing visual uncertainty revealed the role of the distinct haptic cues. The haptic position cue was sufficient to promote multisensory benefits evidenced by faster actions with smaller grip apertures, whereas the haptic size was fundamental in fine-tuning the grip aperture scaling. These results support the hypothesis that, in multisensory grasping, vision is integrated with all haptic cues, with the haptic position cue playing the key part. Our findings highlight the important role of nonvisual sensory inputs in sensorimotor control and hint at the potential contributions of the haptic modality in developing and maintaining visuomotor functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Lessons from the Stories of Women in Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                <p>Women have been contributing to the field of neuroscience since its inception, but their accomplishments are often overlooked. Lack of recognition, among other issues, has led to progressively fewer women at each academic stage; although half of neuroscience graduate students are women, women comprise less than one-third of neuroscience faculty, and even fewer full professors. Those who reach this level continue to struggle to get their work recognized. Women from historically excluded backgrounds are even more starkly underrepresented and face added challenges related to racial, ethnic, and other biases. To increase the visibility of women in neuroscience, promote their voices, and learn about their career journeys, we created Stories of Women in Neuroscience (Stories of WiN). Stories of WiN shares the scientific and personal stories of women neuroscientists with diverse backgrounds, identities, research interests, and at various career stages. From &gt;70 women highlighted thus far, a major theme has emerged: there is not a single archetype of a woman neuroscientist, nor a single path to "success." Yet, through these diverse experiences run common threads, such as the importance of positive early research experiences, managing imposter syndrome, the necessity of work&ndash;life balance, and the challenges of fitting into&mdash;or resisting&mdash;the "scientist mold" within a patriarchal, racialized academic system. These commonalities reveal important considerations for supporting women neuroscientists. Through the lens of women highlighted by Stories of WiN, we explore the similarities among their journeys and detail specific actionable items to help encourage, support, and sustain women in neuroscience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Roles of Par3, Par6, and aPKC Polarity Proteins in Normal Neurodevelopment and in Neurodegenerative and Neuropsychiatric Disorders</a></h4>

              
                <p>Normal neural circuits and functions depend on proper neuronal differentiation, migration, synaptic plasticity, and maintenance. Abnormalities in these processes underlie various neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. Neural development and maintenance are regulated by many proteins. Among them are Par3, Par6 (partitioning defective 3 and 6), and aPKC (atypical protein kinase C) families of evolutionarily conserved polarity proteins. These proteins perform versatile functions by forming tripartite or other combinations of protein complexes, which hereafter are collectively referred to as "Par complexes." In this review, we summarize the major findings on their biophysical and biochemical properties in cell polarization and signaling pathways. We next summarize their expression and localization in the nervous system as well as their versatile functions in various aspects of neurodevelopment, including neuroepithelial polarity, neurogenesis, neuronal migration, neurite differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and memory. These versatile functions rely on the fundamental roles of Par complexes in cell polarity in distinct cellular contexts. We also discuss how cell polarization may correlate with subcellular polarization in neurons. Finally, we review the involvement of Par complexes in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. While emerging evidence indicates that Par complexes are essential for proper neural development and maintenance, many questions on their <I>in vivo</I> functions have yet to be answered. Thus, Par3, Par6, and aPKC continue to be important research topics to advance neuroscience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Depolarizing NaV and Hyperpolarizing KV Channels Are Co-Trafficked in Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal excitability relies on coordinated action of functionally distinction channels. Voltage-gated sodium (Na<SUB>V</SUB>) and potassium (K<SUB>V</SUB>) channels have distinct but complementary roles in firing action potentials: Na<SUB>V</SUB> channels provide depolarizing current while K<SUB>V</SUB> channels provide hyperpolarizing current. Mutations and dysfunction of multiple Na<SUB>V</SUB> and K<SUB>V</SUB> channels underlie disorders of excitability, including pain and epilepsy. Modulating ion channel trafficking may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for these diseases. A fundamental question, however, is whether these channels with distinct functional roles are transported independently or packaged together in the same vesicles in sensory axons. We have used Optical Pulse-Chase Axonal Long-distance imaging to investigate trafficking of Na<SUB>V</SUB> and K<SUB>V</SUB> channels and other axonal proteins from distinct functional classes in live rodent sensory neurons (from male and female rats). We show that, similar to Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7 channels, Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.8 and K<SUB>V</SUB>7.2 channels are transported in Rab6a-positive vesicles, and that each of the Na<SUB>V</SUB> channel isoforms expressed in healthy, mature sensory neurons (Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6, Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7, Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.8, and Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.9) is cotransported in the same vesicles. Further, we show that multiple axonal membrane proteins with different physiological functions (Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7, K<SUB>V</SUB>7.2, and TNFR1) are cotransported in the same vesicles. However, vesicular packaging of axonal membrane proteins is not indiscriminate, since another axonal membrane protein (NCX2) is transported in separate vesicles. These results shed new light on the development and organization of sensory neuron membranes, revealing complex sorting of axonal proteins with diverse physiological functions into specific transport vesicles.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Normal neuronal excitability is dependent on precise regulation of membrane proteins, including Na<SUB>V</SUB> and K<SUB>V</SUB> channels, and imbalance in the level of these channels at the plasma membrane could lead to excitability disorders. Ion channel trafficking could potentially be targeted therapeutically, which would require better understanding of the mechanisms underlying trafficking of functionally diverse channels. Optical Pulse-chase Axonal Long-distance imaging in live neurons permitted examination of the specificity of ion channel trafficking, revealing co-packaging of axonal proteins with opposing physiological functions into the same transport vesicles. This suggests that additional trafficking mechanisms are necessary to regulate levels of surface channels, and reveals an important consideration for therapeutic strategies that target ion channel trafficking for the treatment of excitability disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oxidative Stress-Induced Damage to the Developing Hippocampus Is Mediated by GSK3{beta}</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neonatal brain injury renders the developing brain vulnerable to oxidative stress, leading to cognitive deficit. However, oxidative stress-induced damage to hippocampal circuits and the mechanisms underlying long-term changes in memory and learning are poorly understood. We used high oxygen tension or hyperoxia (HO) in neonatal mice of both sexes to investigate the role of oxidative stress in hippocampal damage. Perinatal HO induces reactive oxygen species and cell death, together with reduced interneuron maturation, inhibitory postsynaptic currents, and dentate progenitor proliferation. Postinjury interneuron stimulation surprisingly improved inhibitory activity and memory tasks, indicating reversibility. With decreased hippocampal levels of Wnt signaling components and somatostatin, HO aberrantly activated glycogen synthase kinase 3 &beta; activity. Pharmacological inhibition or ablation of interneuron glycogen synthase kinase 3 &beta; during HO challenge restored progenitor cell proliferation, interneuron development, inhibitory/excitatory balance, as well as hippocampal-dependent behavior. Biochemical targeting of interneuron function may benefit learning deficits caused by oxidative damage.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Premature infants are especially vulnerable to oxidative stress, as their antioxidant defenses are underdeveloped. Indeed, high oxygen tension is associated with poor neurologic outcomes. Because of its sustained postnatal development and role in learning and memory, the hippocampus is especially vulnerable to oxidative damage in premature infants. However, the role of oxidative stress in the developing hippocampus has yet to be explored. With ever-rising rates of neonatal brain injury and no universally viable approach to maximize functional recovery, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying neonatal brain injury is needed. Addressing this need, this study uses perinatal hyperoxia to study cognitive deficits, pathophysiology, and molecular mechanisms of oxidative damage in the developing hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuropilin 2/Plexin-A3 Receptors Regulate the Functional Connectivity and the Excitability in the Layers 4 and 5 of the Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The functions of cortical networks are progressively established during development by series of events shaping the neuronal connectivity. Synaptic elimination, which consists of removing the supernumerary connections generated during the earlier stages of cortical development, is one of the latest stages in neuronal network maturation. The semaphorin 3F coreceptors neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) and plexin-A3 (PlxnA3) may play an important role in the functional maturation of the cerebral cortex by regulating the excess dendritic spines on cortical excitatory neurons. Yet, the identity of the connections eliminated under the control of Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling is debated, and the importance of this synaptic refinement for cortical functions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Nrp2/PlxnA3 controls the spine densities in layer 4 (L4) and on the apical dendrite of L5 neurons of the sensory and motor cortices. Using a combination of neuroanatomical, <I>ex vivo</I> electrophysiology, and <I>in vivo</I> functional imaging techniques in <I>Nrp2</I> and <I>PlxnA3</I> KO mice of both sexes, we disprove the hypothesis that Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling is required to maintain the ectopic thalamocortical connections observed during embryonic development. We also show that the absence of Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling leads to the hyperexcitability and excessive synchronization of the neuronal activity in L5 and L4 neuronal networks, suggesting that this system could participate in the refinement of the recurrent corticocortical connectivity in those layers. Altogether, our results argue for a role of semaphorin&ndash;Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling in the proper maturation and functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex, likely by controlling the refinement of recurrent corticocortical connections.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The function of a neuronal circuit is mainly determined by the connections that neurons establish with one another during development. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the establishment of the functional connectivity is fundamental to comprehend how network functions are implemented, and to design treatments aiming at restoring damaged neuronal circuits. Here, we show that the cell surface receptors for the family of semaphorin guidance cues neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) and plexin-A3 (PlxnA3) play an important role in shaping the functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex likely by trimming the recurrent connections in layers 4 and 5. By removing the supernumerary inputs generated during early development, Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling reduces the neuronal excitability and participates in the maturation of the cortical network functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Existence of a Long-Range Caudo-Rostral Sensory Influence in Terrestrial Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>In multisegmented locomotion, coordination of all appendages is crucial for the generation of a proper motor output. In running for example, leg coordination is mainly based on the central interaction of rhythm generating networks, called central pattern generators (CPGs). In slower forms of locomotion, however, sensory feedback, which originates from sensory organs that detect changes in position, velocity and load of the legs' segments, has been shown to play a more crucial role. How exactly sensory feedback influences the activity of the CPGs to establish functional neuronal connectivity is not yet fully understood. Using the female stick insect <I>Carausius morosus</I>, we show for the first time that a long-range caudo-rostral sensory connection exists and highlight that load as sensory signal is sufficient to entrain rhythmic motoneuron (MN) activity in the most rostral segment. So far, mainly rostro-caudal influencing pathways have been investigated where the strength of activation, expressed by the MN activity in the thoracic ganglia, decreases with the distance from the stepping leg to these ganglia. Here, we activated CPGs, producing rhythmic neuronal activity in the thoracic ganglia by using the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine and enforced the stepping of a single, remaining leg. This enabled us to study sensory influences on the CPGs' oscillatory activity. Using this approach, we show that, in contrast to the distance-dependent activation of the protractor-retractor CPGs in different thoracic ganglia, there is no such dependence for the entrainment of the rhythmic activity of active protractor-retractor CPG networks by individual stepping legs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show for the first time that sensory information is transferred not only to the immediate adjacent segmental ganglia but also to those farther away, indicating the existence of a long-range caudo-rostral sensory influence. This influence is dependent on stepping direction but independent of whether the leg is actively or passively moved. We suggest that the sensory information comes from unspecific load signals sensed by cuticle mechanoreceptors (campaniform sensilla) of a leg. Our results provide a neuronal basis for the long-established behavioral rules of insect leg coordination. We thus provide a breakthrough in understanding the neuronal networks underlying multilegged locomotion and open new vistas into the neuronal functional connectivity of multisegmented locomotion systems across the animal kingdom.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Vigilance and Behavioral State-Dependent Modulation of Cortical Neuronal Activity throughout the Sleep/Wake Cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABAergic inhibitory neurons, through their molecular, anatomic, and physiological diversity, provide a substrate for the modulation of ongoing cortical circuit activity throughout the sleep/wake cycle. Here, we investigated neuronal activity dynamics of parvalbumin (PV), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and somatostatin (SST) neurons in naturally sleeping head-restrained mice at the level of layer 2/3 of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex of mice. Through calcium imaging and targeted single-unit loose-patch or whole-cell recordings, we found that PV action potential firing activity was largest during both rapid eye movement (REM) and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages, that VIP neurons were most active during REM sleep, and that the overall activity of SST neurons remained stable throughout the sleep/wake cycle. Analysis of neuronal activity dynamics uncovered rapid decreases in PV cell firing at wake onset followed by a progressive recovery during wake. Simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings further revealed that except for SST neurons, a large proportion of neurons were modulated by ongoing delta and theta oscillations. During NREM sleep spindles, PV and SST activity increased and decreased, respectively. Finally, we uncovered the presence of whisking behavior in mice during REM sleep and show that the activity of VIP and SST is differentially modulated during awake and sleeping whisking bouts, which may provide a neuronal substrate for internal brain representations occurring during sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the sensory cortex, the balance between excitation and inhibition is believed to be highly dynamic throughout the sleep/wake cycle, shaping the response of cortical circuits to external stimuli while allowing the formation of newly encoded memory. Using <I>in vivo</I> two-photon calcium imaging or targeted single-unit recordings combined with LFP recordings, we describe the vigilance state and whisking-behavior-dependent activity of excitatory pyramidal and inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the supragranular layers of mouse somatosensory cortex. Interneuronal activity was found to be differentially modulated by ongoing delta and theta waves, sleep spindles, and a novel type of whisking observed during REM sleep, potentially providing a neuronal substrate for internal brain representations occurring during sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brain Functional Connectivity Mapping of Behavioral Flexibility in Rhesus Monkeys</a></h4>

              
                <p>The predisposition to engage in autonomous habitual behaviors has been associated with behavioral disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction. Attentional set-shifting tasks (ASSTs), which incorporate changes governing the association of discriminative stimuli with contingent reinforcement, are commonly used to measure underlying processes of cognitive/behavioral flexibility. The purpose of this study was to identify primate brain networks that mediate trait-like deficits in ASST performance using resting-state fMRI. A self-pacing ASST was administered to three cohorts of rhesus monkeys (total <I>n</I> = 35, 18 female). Increased performance over 30 consecutive sessions segregated the monkeys into two populations, termed High Performers (HP, <I>n</I> = 17) and Low Performers (LP, <I>n</I> = 17), with one anomaly. Compared with LPs, HPs had higher rates of improving performance over sessions and completed the 8 sets/sessions with fewer errors. LP monkeys, on the other hand, spent most of each session in the first set and often did not acquire the first reversal. A whole-brain independent components analysis of resting-state fMRI under isoflurane identified four strong networks. Of these, a dual regression analysis revealed that a designated "executive control network," differed between HPs and LPs. Specific areas of connectivity in the rhesus executive control network, including frontal cortices (ventrolateral, ventromedial, and orbital) and the dorsal striatum (caudate, putamen) correlated with perseverative errors and response latency. Overall, the results identify trait-like characteristics of behavioral flexibility that are associated with correlated brain activity involving specific nuclei of frontostriatal networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Resting state functional connectivity MRI in rhesus monkeys identified specific nuclei in frontostriatal circuitry that were associated with population differences in perseverative and impulsive aspects of cognitive flexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Recruitment of Control and Representational Components of the Semantic System during Successful and Unsuccessful Access to Complex Factual Knowledge</a></h4>

              
                <p>Our ability to effectively retrieve complex semantic knowledge meaningfully impacts our daily lives, yet the neural processes that underly successful access and transient failures in access remain only partially understood. In this fMRI study, we contrast activation during successful semantic access, unsuccessful semantic access because of transient access failures (i.e., "tip-of-the-tongue," "feeling-of-knowing"), and trials where the semantic knowledge was not possessed. Twenty-four human participants (14 female) were presented 240 trivia-based questions relating to person, place, object, or scholastic knowledge domains. Analyses of the recall event indicated a relatively greater role of a dorsomedial section of the prefrontal cortex in unsuccessful semantic access and relatively greater recruitment of the pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus in successful access. Successful access was also associated with increased activation in knowledge domain-selective areas. Generally, knowledge domain-selective areas showed increased responses for both preferred and nonpreferred stimulus classes. The exception was place-selective regions (parahippocampal gyrus, transverse occipital sulcus, retrosplenial complex), which were recruited during unsuccessful access attempts for all stimulus domains. Collectively, these results suggest that prefrontal semantic control systems and classical spatial knowledge-selective regions work together to locate relevant information and that access to complex knowledge results in a broad activation of semantic representation extending to regions selective for other knowledge domains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to access the deep factual knowledge we possess has a meaningful influence on our scholastic, professional, and social lives. In this fMRI study, we investigate the neural processes associated with successful access to this knowledge as well as transient failures in semantic access (tip-of-the-tongue/feeling-of-knowing). Participants attempted to answer trivia-style general knowledge questions drawn from four different knowledge domains. Results suggest that prefrontal semantic control systems and classical spatial knowledge-selective regions work to locate relevant information and that access to complex knowledge results in a broad activation of semantic representation extending to regions selective for other knowledge domains.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Accumulation System: Distributed Neural Substrates of Perceptual Decision Making Revealed by fMRI Deconvolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural substrates of evidence accumulation have been a central issue in decision-making studies because of the prominent success of the accumulation model in explaining a wide range of perceptual decision making. Since accumulation-shaped activities have been found in multiple brain regions, which are called accumulators, questions regarding functional relations among these accumulators are emerging. This study employed the deconvolution method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals from human male and female participants during object-category decision tasks, taking advantage of the whole-brain coverage of fMRI with improved availability of temporal information of the deconvolved activity. We detected the accumulation activity in many non-category-selective regions (NCSRs) over the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes as well as category-selective regions (CSRs) of the categorization task. Importantly, the frontal regions mostly showed activity peaks matching the decision timing (classified as "type-A accumulator"), while activity peaks of the parietal and temporal regions were behind the decision (classified as "type-B accumulator"). The CSRs showed activity peaks whose timing depended on both region and stimulus preference, plausibly reflecting the competition among the alternative choices (classified as "type-C accumulator"). The results suggest that these functionally heterogeneous accumulators form a system for evidence accumulation in which the type-A accumulator regions make decisions in a general manner while the type-B and type-C accumulator regions are employed depending on the modality and content of decision tasks. The concept of the accumulation system may provide a key to understanding the universality of the accumulation model over various kinds of decision tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perceptual decision making, such as deciding to walk or stop on seeing the signal colors, has been explained theoretically by the accumulation model, in which sensory information is accumulated to reach a certain threshold for making decisions. Neural substrates of this model, however, are still under elucidation among candidate regions found over the brain. We show here that, taking advantage of the whole-brain coverage of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with improving availability of temporal information by deconvolution method, the accumulation is conducted by a system comprising many regions in different abstraction levels and only a part of these regions in the frontal cortex make decisions. The system concept may provide a key to explaining the universality of the accumulation model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Simulated Attack Reveals How Lesions Affect Network Properties in Poststroke Aphasia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aphasia is a prevalent cognitive syndrome caused by stroke. The rarity of premorbid imaging and heterogeneity of lesion obscures the links between the local effects of the lesion, global anatomic network organization, and aphasia symptoms. We applied a simulated attack approach in humans to examine the effects of 39 stroke lesions (16 females) on anatomic network topology by simulating their effects in a control sample of 36 healthy (15 females) brain networks. We focused on measures of global network organization thought to support overall brain function and resilience in the whole brain and within the left hemisphere. After removing lesion volume from the network topology measures and behavioral scores [the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient (WAB-AQ), four behavioral factor scores obtained from a neuropsychological battery, and a factor sum], we compared the behavioral variance accounted for by simulated poststroke connectomes to that observed in the randomly permuted data. Global measures of anatomic network topology in the whole brain and left hemisphere accounted for 10% variance or more of the WAB-AQ and the lexical factor score beyond lesion volume and null permutations. Streamline networks provided more reliable point estimates than FA networks. Edge weights and network efficiency were weighted most highly in predicting the WAB-AQ for FA networks. Overall, our results suggest that global network measures provide modest statistical value beyond lesion volume when predicting overall aphasia severity, but less value in predicting specific behaviors. Variability in estimates could be induced by premorbid ability, deafferentation and diaschisis, and neuroplasticity following stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Poststroke, the remaining neuroanatomy maintains cognition and supports recovery. However, studies often use small, cross-sectional samples that cannot fully model the interactions between lesions and other variables that affect networks in stroke. Alternate methods are required to account for these effects. "Simulated attack" models are computational approaches that apply virtual damage to the brain and measure their putative consequences. Using a simulated attack model, we estimated how simulated damage to anatomic networks could account for language performance. Overall, our results reveal that global network measures can provide modest statistical value predicting overall aphasia severity, but less value in predicting specific behaviors. These findings suggest that more theoretically precise network models could be necessary to robustly predict individual outcomes in aphasia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tracking Neural Markers of Template Formation and Implementation in Attentional Inhibition under Different Distractor Consistency</a></h4>

              
                <p>Performing visual search tasks requires optimal attention deployment to promote targets and inhibit distractors. Rejection templates based on the feature of the distractor can be built to constrain the search process. We measured electroencephalography (EEG) of human participants of both sexes when they performed a visual search task in conditions where the distractor cues were constant within a block (fixed cueing) or changed on a trial-by-trial basis (varied cueing). In the fixed-cueing condition, sustained decoding of the cued colors could be achieved during the retention interval, and participants with higher decoding accuracy showed larger suppression benefits of the distractor cueing in the search period. In the varied-cueing condition, the cued color could only be transiently decoded after its onset, and higher decoding accuracy was observed from the participants who demonstrated lower suppression benefit. The differential neural representations of the to-be-ignored color in the two cueing conditions as well as their reverse associations with behavioral performance implied that rejection templates were formed in the fixed-cueing condition but not in the varied-cueing condition. Additionally, we observed stronger posterior alpha lateralization and midfrontal theta/beta power during the retention interval of the varied-cueing condition, indicating the cognitive costs in template formation caused by the trialwise change of distractor colors. Together, our findings revealed the neural markers associated with the critical roles of distractor consistency in linking template formation to successful inhibition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How do we strategically build a rejection template based on distractor features to filter out matched items when performing visual search tasks? Previous studies have suggested that the consistency of the to-be-ignored feature may play a significant role in this process. We recorded scalp EEGs when human participants searched for a target among distractors. Capitalized on multivariate decoding technique and time-frequency analysis, we revealed the neural markers of the rejection template under different distractor consistencies. Being able to track these processes in visual search could help us to understand the connection between template formation and successful distractor inhibition. Our findings may also benefit future EEG-based interventions on individuals with deficits in attentional control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Quantitative Model of Sporadic Axonal Degeneration in the Drosophila Visual System</a></h4>

              
                <p>In human neurodegenerative diseases, neurons undergo axonal degeneration months to years before they die. Here, we developed a system modeling early degenerative events in <I>Drosophila</I> adult photoreceptor cells. Thanks to the stereotypy of their axonal projections, this system delivers quantitative data on sporadic and progressive axonal degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Using this method, we show that exposure of adult female flies to a constant light stimulation for several days overcomes the intrinsic resilience of R7 photoreceptors and leads to progressive axonal degeneration. This was not associated with apoptosis. We furthermore provide evidence that loss of synaptic integrity between R7 and a postsynaptic partner preceded axonal degeneration, thus recapitulating features of human neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, our experiments uncovered a role of postsynaptic partners of R7 to initiate degeneration, suggesting that postsynaptic cells signal back to the photoreceptor to maintain axonal structure. This model can be used to dissect cellular and circuit mechanisms involved in the early events of axonal degeneration, allowing for a better understanding of how neurons cope with stress and lose their resilience capacities.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons can be active and functional for several years. In the course of aging and in disease conditions leading to neurodegeneration, subsets of neurons lose their resilience and start dying. What initiates this turning point at the cellular level is not clear. Here, we developed a model allowing to systematically describe this phase. The loss of synapses and axons represents an early and functionally relevant event toward degeneration. Using the ordered distribution of <I>Drosophila</I> photoreceptor axon terminals, we assembled a system to study sporadic initiation of axon loss and delineated a role for non-cell-autonomous activity regulation in the initiation of axon degeneration. This work will help shed light on key steps in the etiology of nonfamilial cases of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Explainable detection of adverse drug reaction with imbalanced data distribution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jin Wang, Liang-Chih Yu, Xuejie Zhang</p>

Analysis of health-related texts can be used to detect adverse drug reactions (ADR). The greatest challenge for ADR detection lies in imbalanced data distributions where words related to ADR symptoms are often minority classes. As a result, trained models tend to converge to a point that strongly biases towards the majority class and then ignores the minority class. Since the most used cross-entropy criteria is an approximation to accuracy, the model focuses more readily on the majority class to achieve high accuracy. To address this issue, existing methods apply either oversampling or down-sampling strategies to balance the data distribution and exploit the most difficult samples of the minority class. However, increasing or reducing the number of individual tokens alone in sequence labeling tasks will result in the loss of the syntactic relations of the sentence. This paper proposes a weighted variant of conditional random field (CRF) for data-imbalanced sequence labeling tasks. Such a weighting strategy can alleviate data distribution imbalances between majority and minority classes. Instead of using <i>softmax</i> in the output layer, the CRF can capture the relationship of labels between tokens. The locally interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) algorithm was applied to investigate performance differences between models with and without the weighted loss function. Experimental results on two different ADR tasks show that the proposed model outperforms previously proposed sequence labeling methods.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SPF: A spatial and functional data analytic approach to cell imaging data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thao Vu, Julia Wrobel, Benjamin G. Bitler, Erin L. Schenk, Kimberly R. Jordan, Debashis Ghosh</p>

The tumor microenvironment (TME), which characterizes the tumor and its surroundings, plays a critical role in understanding cancer development and progression. Recent advances in imaging techniques enable researchers to study spatial structure of the TME at a single-cell level. Investigating spatial patterns and interactions of cell subtypes within the TME provides useful insights into how cells with different biological purposes behave, which may consequentially impact a subject’s clinical outcomes. We utilize a class of well-known spatial summary statistics, the K-function and its variants, to explore inter-cell dependence as a function of distances between cells. Using techniques from functional data analysis, we introduce an approach to model the association between these summary spatial functions and subject-level outcomes, while controlling for other clinical scalar predictors such as age and disease stage. In particular, we leverage the additive functional Cox regression model (AFCM) to study the nonlinear impact of spatial interaction between tumor and stromal cells on overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data. The applicability of our approach is further validated using a publicly available multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) triple-negative breast cancer dataset.

    Abstract

    Eggs contain about 200,000 mitochondria that generate adenosine triphosphate and metabolites essential for oocyte development. Mitochondria also integrate metabolism and transcription via metabolites that regulate epigenetic modifiers, but there is no direct evidence linking oocyte mitochondrial function to the maternal epigenome and subsequent embryo development. Here, we have disrupted oocyte mitochondrial function via deletion of the mitochondrial fission factor Drp1. Fission-deficient oocytes exhibit a high frequency of failure in peri- and postimplantation development. This is associated with altered mitochondrial function, changes in the oocyte transcriptome and proteome, altered subcortical maternal complex, and a decrease in oocyte DNA methylation and H3K27me3. Transplanting pronuclei of fertilized Drp1 knockout oocytes to normal ooplasm fails to rescue embryonic lethality. We conclude that mitochondrial function plays a role in establishing the maternal epigenome, with serious consequences for embryo development.

   <div>
    Recently, stationary wireless power transfer (WPT) has been widely adopted in commercial devices. However, the current WPT configuration is limited in its operational area and susceptible to operating condition changes, impeding its applications for dynamic environments. To overcome the limitations, we propose a WPT system with laterally aligned neutral elements in parity-time (PT) symmetry, which can widen the operational area with the number of neutrals
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    . Compared to the conventional multiple-input–single-output WPT, the dimension of system complexity is substantially reduced from
    <i>
     R

    because the neutral amplitudes are simply controlled by coupling capacitors. The operational frequency is automatically adjusted to a real eigenvalue of the PT-symmetric system to achieve high voltage gain and efficiency, making the system robust. The performance of the system calculated by the coupled-mode theory was experimentally verified with rigid and flexible types of receivers, confirming its potential in both industrial and biomedical electronics.

    Chiral discrimination, a problem of vital importance, has recently become an emerging frontier in ultrafast physics, with remarkable progress achieved in multiphoton and strong-field regimes. Rydberg excitations, unavoidable in the strong-field regime and intentional for few-photon processes, arise in all these approaches. Here, we show how to harness this ubiquitous feature by introducing a new phenomenon, enantiosensitive free-induction decay, steered by a tricolor chiral field at a gentle intensity, structured in space and time. We demonstrate theoretically that an excited chiral molecule accumulates an enantiosensitive phase due to perturbative interactions with the tricolor chiral field, resulting in a spatial phase gradient steering the free-induction decay in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. Our work introduces a general, extremely sensitive, all-optical enantiosensitive detection technique that avoids strong fields and takes full advantage of recent advances in structuring light.

    The current-induced spin-orbit torque switching of ferromagnets has had huge impact in spintronics. However, short spin-diffusion lengths limit the thickness of switchable ferromagnetic layers, thereby limiting their thermal stability.

    Sn. The mechanism involves setting the orientation of the antiferromagnetic domains in a thin region at the interface with spin currents arising from an adjacent heavy metal while also heating the layer above its magnetic ordering temperature. This interface region seeds the resulting spin texture of the entire layer as it cools down and, thereby, overcomes the thickness limitation of conventional spin-orbit torques. SSOT switching in Mn

    Sn can be extended beyond chiral antiferromagnets to diverse magnetic systems and provides a path toward the development of highly efficient, high-speed, and thermally stable spintronic devices.

    The subsynaptic organization of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors into nanoclusters that are aligned with presynaptic release sites is essential for the high fidelity of synaptic transmission. However, the mechanisms controlling the nanoscale organization of neurotransmitter receptors in vivo remain incompletely understood. Here, we deconstructed the role of neuroligin-3 (Nlgn3), a postsynaptic adhesion molecule linked to autism, in organizing AMPA-type glutamate receptors in the calyx of Held synapse. Deletion of
    <i>
     Nlgn3
    </i>
    lowered the amplitude and slowed the kinetics of AMPA receptor–mediated synaptic responses. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that, unexpectedly, these impairments in synaptic transmission were associated with an increase in the size of postsynaptic PSD-95 and AMPA receptor nanoclusters but a decrease of the densities in these clusters. Modeling showed that a dilution of AMPA receptors into larger nanocluster volumes decreases synaptic strength. Nlgn3, likely by binding to presynaptic neurexins, thus is a key organizer of AMPA receptor nanoclusters that likely acts via PSD-95 adaptors to optimize the fidelity of synaptic transmission.

    Abstract

   <div>
    A foundational assumption of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) inequality research is that members of the most well represented demographic group—white able-bodied heterosexual men (WAHM)—are uniquely privileged in STEM. But is this really the case? Using survey data of U.S. STEM professionals (
    <i>
     N
    </i>
    = 25,324), this study examines whether WAHM experience better treatment and rewards in STEM compared with members of all 31 other intersectional gender, race, sexual identity, and disability status categories. Indicating systematic advantages accompanying WAHM status, WAHM experience more social inclusion, professional respect, and career opportunities, and have higher salaries and persistence intentions than STEM professionals in 31 other intersectional groups. Decomposition analyses illustrate that these advantages operate in part as premiums—benefits attached to WAHM status that cannot be attributed to variation in human capital, work effort, and other factors. These findings motivate research and policy efforts to move beyond a single axis paradigm to better understand and address intersectional (dis)advantages in STEM.

    Wavelength and polarization are two fundamental properties of light within which information can be encoded and (de)multiplexed. While wavelength-selective systems have widely proliferated, polarization-addressable active photonics has not seen notable progress, primarily because tunable and polarization-selective nanostructures have been elusive. Here, we introduce hybridized-active-dielectric (HAD) nanowires to achieve polarization-selective tunability. We then demonstrate the ability to use polarization as a parameter to selectively modulate the conductance of individual nanowires within a multi-nanowire system. By using polarization as the tunable vector, we show matrix-vector multiplication in a nanowire device configuration. While our HAD nanowires use phase-change materials as the active material, this concept is readily generalized to other active materials hybridized with dielectrics and thus has the potential in a broad range of applications from photonic memories and routing to polarization-multiplexed computing.

    Abstract

   <div>
    The Hi-C technique has been shown to be a promising method to detect structural variations (SVs) in human genomes. However, algorithms that can use Hi-C data for a full-range SV detection have been severely lacking. Current methods can only identify interchromosomal translocations and long-range intrachromosomal SVs (&gt;1 Mb) at less-than-optimal resolution. Therefore, we develop EagleC, a framework that combines deep-learning and ensemble-learning strategies to predict a full range of SVs at high resolution. We show that EagleC can uniquely capture a set of fusion genes that are missed by whole-genome sequencing or nanopore. Furthermore, EagleC also effectively captures SVs in other chromatin interaction platforms, such as HiChIP, Chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), and capture Hi-C. We apply EagleC in more than 100 cancer cell lines and primary tumors and identify a valuable set of high-quality SVs. Last, we demonstrate that EagleC can be applied to single-cell Hi-C and used to study the SV heterogeneity in primary tumors.

    Rotation of micro/nano-objects is important for micro/nanorobotics, three-dimensional imaging, and lab-on-a-chip systems. Optical rotation techniques are especially attractive because of their fuel-free and remote operation. However, current techniques require laser beams with designed intensity profile and polarization or objects with sophisticated shapes or optical birefringence. These requirements make it challenging to use simple optical setups for light-driven rotation of many highly symmetric or isotropic objects, including biological cells. Here, we report a universal approach to the out-of-plane rotation of various objects, including spherically symmetric and isotropic particles, using an arbitrary low-power laser beam. Moreover, the laser beam is positioned away from the objects to reduce optical damage from direct illumination. The rotation mechanism based on opto-thermoelectrical coupling is elucidated by rigorous experiments combined with multiscale simulations. With its general applicability and excellent biocompatibility, our universal light-driven rotation platform is instrumental for various scientific research and engineering applications.

    Bacteria organize in a variety of collective states, from swarming—rapid surface exploration, to biofilms—highly dense immobile communities attributed to stress resistance. It has been suggested that biofilm and swarming are oppositely controlled, making this transition particularly interesting for understanding the ability of bacterial colonies to adapt to challenging environments. Here, the swarm to biofilm transition is studied in
    <i>
     Bacillus subtilis
    </i>
    by analyzing the bacterial dynamics both on the individual and collective scales. We show that both biological and physical processes facilitate the transition. A few individual cells that initiate the biofilm program cause nucleation of large, approximately scale-free, stationary aggregates of trapped swarm cells. Around aggregates, cells continue swarming almost unobstructed, while inside, trapped cells are added to the biofilm. While our experimental findings rule out previously suggested purely physical effects as a trigger for biofilm formation, they show how physical processes, such as clustering and jamming, accelerate biofilm formation.

    Photonic neural networks perform brain-inspired computations using photons instead of electrons to achieve substantially improved computing performance. However, existing architectures can only handle data with regular structures but fail to generalize to graph-structured data beyond Euclidean space. Here, we propose the diffractive graph neural network (DGNN), an all-optical graph representation learning architecture based on the diffractive photonic computing units (DPUs) and on-chip optical devices to address this limitation. Specifically, the graph node attributes are encoded into strip optical waveguides, transformed by DPUs, and aggregated by optical couplers to extract their feature representations. DGNN captures complex dependencies among node neighborhoods during the light-speed optical message passing over graph structures. We demonstrate the applications of DGNN for node and graph-level classification tasks with benchmark databases and achieve superior performance. Our work opens up a new direction for designing application-specific integrated photonic circuits for high-efficiency processing large-scale graph data structures using deep learning.

    HYPK rescues this phenotype. Combined transcriptomics, proteomics, and N-terminomics unravel that HYPK impairs plant metabolism and development, predominantly by regulating NatA activity.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to regulate cell differentiation in other eukaryotes. To determine whether lncRNAs are also involved in parasite differentiation, we used RNA sequencing to survey the
    <i>
     T. brucei
    </i>
    genome, identifying 1428 previously uncharacterized lncRNA genes. We find that
    <i>
     grumpy
    </i>
    lncRNA is a key regulator that promotes parasite differentiation into the quiescent stumpy form. This function is promoted by a small nucleolar RNA encoded within the
    <i>
     grumpy
    </i>
    lncRNA.
    <i>
     snoGRUMPY
    </i>
    binds to messenger RNAs of at least two stumpy regulatory genes, promoting their expression.
    <i>
     grumpy
    </i>
    overexpression reduces parasitemia in infected mice. Our analyses suggest that
    <i>
     T. brucei
    </i>
    lncRNAs modulate parasite-host interactions and provide a mechanism by which
    <i>

    regulates cell differentiation in trypanosomes.

   <div>
    Miniaturization has evolved repeatedly in frogs in the moist leaf litter environments of rainforests worldwide. Miniaturized frogs are among the world’s smallest vertebrates and exhibit an array of enigmatic features. One area where miniaturization has predictable consequences is the vestibular system, which acts as a gyroscope, providing sensory information about movement and orientation. We investigated the vestibular system of pumpkin toadlets,
    <i>
     Brachycephalus
    </i>
    (Anura: Brachycephalidae), a clade of miniaturized frogs from Brazil. The semicircular canals of miniaturized frogs are the smallest recorded for adult vertebrates, resulting in low sensitivity to angular acceleration due to insufficient displacement of endolymph. This translates into a lack of postural control during jumping in
    <i>
     Brachycephalus
    </i>
    and represents a physical constraint resulting from Poiseuille’s law, which governs movement of fluids within tubes.

    Abstract
   </h2>
   <div>
    The world’s coral reefs are experiencing increasing volatility in coral cover, largely because of anthropogenic environmental change, highlighting the need to understand how such volatility will influence the structure and dynamics of reef assemblages. These changes may influence not only richness or evenness but also the temporal stability of species’ relative abundances (temporal beta-diversity). Here, we analyzed reef fish assemblage time series from the Great Barrier Reef to show that, overall, 75% of the variance in abundance among species was attributable to persistent differences in species’ long-term mean abundances. However, the relative importance of stochastic fluctuations in abundance was higher on reefs that experienced greater volatility in coral cover, whereas it did not vary with drivers of alpha-diversity. These findings imply that increased coral cover volatility decreases temporal stability in relative abundances of fishes, a transformation that is not detectable from static measures of biodiversity.

    Grass inflorescence development is diverse and complex and involves sophisticated but poorly understood interactions of genes regulating branch determinacy and leaf growth. Here, we use a combination of transcript profiling and genetic and phylogenetic analyses to investigate

    Traceless physical cues are desirable for remote control of the in situ production and real-time dosing of biopharmaceuticals in cell-based therapies. However, current optogenetic, magnetogenetic, or electrogenetic devices require sophisticated electronics, complex artificial intelligence–assisted software, and external energy supplies for power and control. Here, we describe a self-sufficient subcutaneous push button–controlled cellular implant powered simply by repeated gentle finger pressure exerted on the overlying skin. Pushing the button causes transient percutaneous deformation of the implant’s embedded piezoelectric membrane, which produces sufficient low-voltage energy inside a semi-permeable platinum-coated cell chamber to mediate rapid release of a biopharmaceutical from engineered electro-sensitive human cells. Release is fine-tuned by varying the frequency and duration of finger-pressing stimulation. As proof of concept, we show that finger-pressure activation of the subcutaneous implant can restore normoglycemia in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. Self-sufficient push-button devices may provide a new level of convenience for patients to control their cell-based therapies.

    Itch is an unpleasant sensation that often accompanies chronic dermatological conditions. Although many of the itch receptors and the neural pathways underlying this sensation are known, the identity of endogenous ligands is still not fully appreciated. Using an unbiased bioinformatic approach, we identified GPR15L as a candidate pruritogen whose expression is robustly up-regulated in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Although GPR15L was previously shown to be a cognate ligand of the receptor GPR15, expressed in dermal T cells, here we show that it also contributes to pruritogenesis by activating Mas-related G protein–coupled receptors (MRGPRs). GPR15L can selectively stimulate mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons that express Mrgpra3 and evokes intense itch responses. GPR15L causes mast cell degranulation through stimulation of MRGPRX2 and Mrgprb2. Genetic disruption of GPR15L expression attenuates scratch responses in a mouse model of psoriasis. Our study reveals unrecognized features of GRP15L, showing that it is a potent itch-inducing agent.

This paper aims to explore socioeconomic and environmental factors that influence forest degradation, project future scenarios, and assess the impact on the regional carbon balance, combining forest degradation and deforestation-related processes (clear-cut deforestation and secondary vegetation dynamics).

                Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into nerve cells with an induction from chemical compounds in medium culture. Chromolaena odorata contains active compounds, such as alkaloids and flavonoids, that can initiate the transformation of MSCs into nerve cells. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of methanol extracted C. odorata leaf to induce the differentiation of bone marrow MSCs into nerve cells. Methods: A serial concentration of C. odorata leaf extract (0.7–1.0 mg/mL) with two replications was used. The parameters measured were the number of differentiated MSCs into nerve cells (statistically analyzed using ANOVA) and cell confirmation using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The results showed that the C. odorata extract had a significant effect on the number MSCs differentiating into nerve cells (p < 0.05) on the doses of 0.8 mg/ml with 22.6%. Molecular assay with RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the nerve cell gene in all of the samples. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study showed the potential application of C. odorata leaf extract in stem cell therapy for patients experiencing neurodegeneration by inducing the differentiation of MSCs into nerve cells.

                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has fomented a climate of fear worldwide due to its rapidly spreading nature, and high mortality rate. The World Health Organization declared it a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Many endeavors have been made to find appropriate medications to restrain the SARS-CoV-2 infection from spreading but there is no specific antiviral therapy to date. However, a computer-aided drug design approach can be an alternative to identify probable drug candidates within a short time. SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a proven drug target, and it plays a pivotal role in viral replication and transcription. Methods: In this study, we identified a total of 114 essential oil compounds as a feasible anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent from several online reservoirs. These compounds were screened by incorporating absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiling, molecular docking, and 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulation to identify potential drug candidates. The crystallized SARS-CoV-2 main protease structure was collected from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank database (Protein Data Bank ID 6LU7). Results: According to the results of the ADMET study, none of the compounds have any side effects that could reduce their druglikeness or pharmacokinetic properties. Among 114 compounds, we selected bisabololoxide B, eremanthin, and leptospermone as top drug candidates based on their higher binding affinity scores, and strong interaction with the Cys 145-His 41 catalytic dyad. Finally, the molecular dynamics simulation was implemented to evaluate the structural stability of the ligand-receptor complex. Molecular dynamics simulation disclosed that all the hits showed conformational stability compared to the positive control α-ketoamide. Conclusions: Our study showed that the top three hits might work as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, which can pave the way for discovering new drugs, but further in vivo trials will require for experimental validation.

OCT data was acquired with 1) Spectralis spectral domain OCT (MOGAD (N=66) and HC (N=103)) and 2) Cirrus HD-OCT (MOGAD (N=14) and HC (N=36)). Macular combined ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) were quantified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, GCIPL and pRNFL were lower in MOGAD eyes with a history of ON (MOGAD-ON) compared with MOGAD eyes without a history of ON (MOGAD-NON) and HC (p&lt;0.001). MOGAD-NON eyes had lower GCIPL volume compared to HC (p&lt;0.001) in the Spectralis, but not in the Cirrus cohort. Longitudinally (follow-up up to 3 years), MOGAD-ON with ON within the last 6-12 months before baseline exhibited greater pRNFL thinning than MOGAD-ON with an ON &gt;12 months ago (p&lt;0.001). The overall MOGAD cohort did not exhibit faster GCIPL thinning compared with HC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study suggests the absence of attack-independent retinal damage in MOGAD. Yet, ongoing neuroaxonal damage or oedema resolution seems to occur for up to 12 months after ON, which is longer than what has been reported with other ON forms. These findings support that the pathomechanisms underlying optic nerve involvement and the evolution of OCT retinal changes after ON is distinct in MOGAD.</p>

     alt="Calcium-binding proteins typify the dopaminergic neuronal subtypes in the ventral tegmental area of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata"/>
<p>Graphical Abstract: Dopamine (DA) neurons residing in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain of zebra finch demonstrate distinct differences in size and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir). The DA neurons in VTA were smaller than those in SN. Based on TH-ir, VTA neurons have been demarcated as subtype 1, 2, and 3. The further study probed the nature of the calcium binding proteins (CBPs), namely, Calbindin (CB)-, Calretinin (CR)-, Parvalbumin (PV)-, and Secretagogin (SCGN)-expressing DA neurons in the VTA and SN. CBPs mRNA and protein showed differential expression in VTA subdivisions and SN. While the subtype 1 TH neurons in the VTA were CB- or CR-negative, subtype 2 and 3 TH neurons co-expressed CB and CR, respectively. Neurons expressing SCGN were observed only in the SN. All subtypes of TH neurons in the VTA co-expressed PV, and the PV and TH-ir showed reciprocal relationship.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Calcium-binding proteins (CBPs) regulate neuronal function in midbrain dopamine (DA)-ergic neurons in mammals by buffering and sensing the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and vesicular release. In birds, the equivalent set of neurons are important in song learning, directed singing, courtship, and energy balance, yet the status of CBPs in these neurons is unknown. Herein, for the first time, we probe the nature of CBPs, namely, Calbindin-, Calretinin-, Parvalbumin-, and Secretagogin-expressing DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain of zebra finch, <i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>. qRT-PCR analysis of ventral midbrain tissue fragment revealed higher Calbindin- and Calretinin-mRNA levels compared to Parvalbumin and Secretagogin. Application of immunofluorescence showed CBP-immunoreactive (-i) neurons in VTA (anterior [VTAa], mid [VTAm], caudal [VTAc]), SN (compacta [SNc], and reticulata [SNr]). Compared to VTAa, higher Calbindin- and Parvalbumin-immunoreactivity (-ir), and lower Calretinin-ir were observed in VTAm and VTAc. Secretagogin-ir was highly localized to VTAa. In SN, Calbindin- and Calretinin-ir were higher in SNc, SNr was Parvalbumin enriched, and Secretagogin-ir was not detected. Weak, moderate, and intense tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-i VTA neurons were demarcated as subtypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. While subtype 1 TH-i neurons were neither Calbindin- nor Calretinin-i, ∼80 and ∼65% subtype 2 and ∼30 and ∼45% subtype 3 TH-i neurons co-expressed Calbindin and Calretinin, respectively. All TH-i neuronal subtypes co-expressed Parvalbumin with reciprocal relationship with TH-ir. We suggest that the CBPs may determine VTA DA neuronal heterogeneity and differentially regulate their activity in <i>T. guttata</i>.</p>

                Background: Vaccination is an effective and alternative means of disease prevention, however, it cannot be conducted on the offspring of fish.  For this process to take place, the transfer of maternal immunity must be implemented. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of transferring immunity from the broodstock to the offspring using a polyvalent vaccine against Aeromonas hydrophila, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Pseudomonas fluorescens in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Methods: Nile tilapia broodstock, with an average weight of 203g (±SD 23 g) was injected with a vaccine used as a treatment. Example include A. hydrophila monovalent (MA), S. agalactiae monovalent (MS), P. fluorescens monovalent (MP), A. hydrophila and S. agalactiae bivalent (BAS), A. hydrophila and P. fluorescens bivalent (BAP), P. fluorescens and S. agalactiae bivalent (BPS), and A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, and P. fluorescens polyvalent vaccines (PAPS). While the control was fish that were injected with a PBS solution. The broodstock’s immune response was observed on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th day, while the immune response and challenge test on the offspring was conducted on the 10th, 20th, 30th, and 40th day during the post-hatching period. Result: The application of PAPS in broodstock could significantly induce the best immune response and immunity to multiple diseases compared to other treatments. The RPS of the PAPS was also higher than the other types of vaccines. This showed that the transfer of immunity from the broodstock to the Nile tilapia offspring could protect it against bacterial diseases such as A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, and P. fluorescens. Conclusion: The application of PAPS A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, P. fluorescens vaccines increased the broodstock’s immune response and it was transferred to their offsprings. They were able to produce tilapia seeds that are immune to diseases caused by A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, and P. fluorescens.

                <p>In this one-year prospective study, Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with or without mania following STN-DBS were compared to investigate risk and etiological factors, clinical management and consequences. Eighteen (16.2%) out of 111 consecutive PD patients developed mania, of whom 17 were males. No preoperative risk factor was identified. Postoperative mania was related to ventral limbic subthalamic stimulation in 15 (83%) patients, and resolved as stimulation was relocated to the sensorimotor STN, besides discontinuation or reduction of dopamine agonists and use of low-dose clozapine in 12 patients, while motor and nonmotor outcomes were similar. These findings underpin the prominent role of limbic subthalamic stimulation in postoperative mania.</p>

                Background: Actual and potential drug–drug interactions of psychotropic drugs in patients of the COVID-19 Medicine Service of the Villa El Salvador Emergency Hospital during the months of February to July, 2021. Methods: The study is deductive, retroprospective, quantitative, applied, cross-sectional observational. The instrument used was a collection card for 86 pharmacotherapeutic follow-ups where psychotropic drugs for anxiety, depression and insomnia were registered. Results: In the actual and potential drug interactions of psychotropic drugs, according to the degree of severity dimension, it was identified that the important indicator represented the highest frequency of 89% of the interactions; according to the type of interaction dimension, it was identified that the pharmacodynamic indicator presented a higher frequency with 53%; according to the clinical evidence dimension, it was identified that the fair indicator had a higher frequency with 73% interactions; in the manifestation dimension, it was identified that the potential indicator presented a higher frequency with 92.2% interactions. In its moment of appearance dimension, it was identified that the quick indicator had a higher prevalence with 5.5% of real interactions. In its causality algorithm dimension, the probable indicator was identified as having the highest frequency with 7.25% of actual interactions. With respect to sex, the male presented 49.9% of potential interactions and in the real interactions, the female sex presented a higher incidence with 4.3% interactions. The average age of the potential interactions was 48.83 years, and the average age of the real interactions was 45.67 years. Sertraline presented 53.2% of potential interactions and in relation to real drug interactions the one that presented the highest frequency was mirtazapine with 3.5% interactions. Conclusion: We conclude that the increase in the prescription of psychotropic drugs is related to a higher probability of interactions.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in neurons is a prominent feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, researchers have considered that extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play an important role in protein exportation and propagation, and α-syn-containing EVs derived from the central nervous system (CNS) have been detected in peripheral blood. However, mechanistic insights into CNS-derived EVs have not been well-described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Likely neurogenic EVs were purified from the plasma of PD patients and healthy controls using a well-established immunoprecipitation assay with anti-L1CAM-coated beads. A <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mouse model was used to evaluate the neuronal pathology induced by PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs. EV-associated microRNA (miRNA) profiling was used to screen for altered miRNAs in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PD patient-derived L1CAM-purified (likely neurogenic) EVs facilitated α-syn pathology and neuron loss in <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mice. The miRNA, novel_miR_44438, was significantly increased in the PD group, which promoted α-syn accumulation and neuronal degeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Novel _miR_44438 directly targets NDST1 mRNA and inhibits the function of heparan sulfate, thus preventing exosome biogenesis and α-syn release from exosomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel_miR_44438 in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs inhibits the α-syn efflux from neurons thereby promoting the pathological accumulation and aggregation of α-syn. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Pregnane neurosteroids exert opposite effects on GABA and glycine‐induced chloride current in isolated rat neurons</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability of endogenous neurosteroids (NSs) with pregnane skeleton modified at positions C-3 and C-5 to modulate the functional activity of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyR) and ionotropic ɣ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) was estimated. The glycine and GABA-induced chloride current (<i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>) were measured in isolated pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus and in isolated rat cerebellar Purkinje cells, respectively. Our experiments demonstrated that pregnane NSs affected <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> in a different manner. At low concentrations (up to 5 μM), tested pregnane NSs increased or did not change the peak amplitude of the <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>, but reduced the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> by decreasing the peak amplitude and/or accelerating desensitization. Namely, allopregnanolone (ALLO), epipregnanolone (EPI), pregnanolone (PA), pregnanolone sulfate (PAS) and 5β-dihydroprogesterone (5β-DHP) enhanced the <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub> in Purkinje cells. Dose–response curves plotted in the concentration range from 1 nM to 100 μM were smooth for EPI and 5β-DHP, but bell-shaped for ALLO, PA and PAS. The peak amplitude of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> was reduced by PA, PAS, and 5α- and 5β-DHP. In contrast, ALLO, ISO and EPI did not modulate it. Dose–response curves for the inhibition of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> peak amplitude were smooth for all active compounds. All NSs accelerated desensitization of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub>. The dose–response relationship for this effect was smooth for ALLO, PA, PAS and 5β-DHP, but it was U-shaped for EPI, 5α-DHP and ISO. These results, together with our previous results on NSs with androstane skeleton, offer comprehensive overview for understanding the mechanisms of effects of NSs on <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge and practice of community pharmacists towards SGLT2 inhibitors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of oral anti-diabetic drugs which improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by preventing the kidney from reabsorbing glucose back to blood. Community pharmacists have long-term relationships with most of their chronic patients, so they play a key role in care for people with diabetes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess pharmacists’ knowledge and practice towards SGLT2 inhibitors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to meet the study objectives. A convenience sample of 348 community pharmacists in Jordan was recruited. knowledge and practice were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire created for the purpose of this study. Results: A total of 400 community pharmacists were reached, of whom 348 answered the survey (response rate 87%). The results indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors knowledge score among community pharmacists in Jordan was 6.61 (out of 12). Factors like age, gender, location of the pharmacy, years of pharmacists’ experience had no effect on knowledge score; however, pharmacists who attended training courses on diabetes had higher knowledge scores. Additionally, pharmacists’ dispensing practice toward SGLT2 inhibitors had insufficient knowledge, such as lack of knowledge about the superiority of SGLT2 inhibitors over other anti-diabetics and inability to give the best advice to patients. Conclusions: Our findings reflect a moderate knowledge among community pharmacists about SGLT2 inhibitors which may negatively affect the patients’ outcome; thus, continuous education for the pharmacists is essential.

                The crime of electromagnetic records under unauthorized instruction (Article 168-2 and 3 of the Penal Code) requires that the program or the instruction code in question is against the intention of the computer user (counterintentionality) and socially unacceptable (unauthorized), as the requirements of objectivity. The significance or factors to be considered in the requirements of “counterintentionality” and “unauthorized” have not been clarified in practice. This paper examines the requirements of “counterintentionality” and “unauthorized” intent in crimes related to electromagnetic records with the Coinhive case as material, by means of a literature survey and case study. In addition, the significance and scope of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Coinhive case will be clarified.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The structure of the mammalian auditory brainstem is evolutionarily highly plastic, and distinct nuclei arrange in a species-dependent manner. Such anatomical variability is present in the superior olivary complex (SOC) and the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (LL). Due to the structure–function relationship in the auditory brainstem, the identification of individual nuclei supports the understanding of sound processing. Here, we comparatively describe the nucleus arrangement and the expression of functional markers in the auditory brainstem of the two bat species <i>Phyllostomus discolor</i> and <i>Carollia perspicillata</i>. Using immunofluorescent labeling, we describe the arrangement and identity of the SOC and LL nuclei based on the expression of synaptic markers (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and glycine transporter 2), calcium-binding proteins, as well as the voltage-gated ion channel subunits Kv1.1 and HCN1. The distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic labeling appears similar between both species and matches with that of other mammals. The detection of calcium-binding proteins indicates species-dependent differences and deviations from other mammals. Kv1.1 and HCN1 show largely the same expression pattern in both species, which diverges from other mammals, indicating functional adaptations in the cellular physiology of bat neurons.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cavities in the hippocampus are morphological variants of uncertain significance. Aberrant neurodevelopment along with vascular and inflammatory etiologies have been proposed. We sought to characterize these cavities and their potential risk factors in a marginally housed population, with high rates of viral infection, addiction, and mental illness. (1) The volume of hippocampal cavities (HCavs) is greater in this highly multimorbid population compared to the general population. (2) Conventional vascular risk factors such as greater age and systolic blood pressure are associated with higher HCav volume. (3) Nonprescribed substance-related risk factors such as stimulant use or dependence, and smoking are associated with increased HCav volume independent of vascular risk factors. This is a retrospective analysis of an ongoing prospective study. We analyzed baseline data, including medical history, physical exam, psychiatric diagnosis, and MRI from a total of 375 participants. Hippocampal cavities were defined as spaces isointense to CSF on T1 MRI sequences, bounded on all sides by hippocampal tissue, with a volume of at least 1 mm<sup>3</sup>. Risk factors were evaluated using negative binomial multiple regression. Stimulant use was reported by 87.3% of participants, with stimulant dependence diagnosed in 83.3% of participants. Prevalence of cavities was 71.6%, with a mean total bilateral HCav volume of 13.89 mm<sup>3</sup>. On average, a 1 mmHg greater systolic blood pressure was associated with a 2.17% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [0.57%, 3.79%], p = .0076), while each cigarette smoked per day trended toward a 2.69% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [−0.87%, 5.54%], p = .058). A diagnosis of stimulant dependence was associated with a 95.6% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [5.39%, 263.19%], p = .0335). Hypertension and diagnosis of stimulant dependence were associated with a greater total volume of HCav.</p>
