                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Breastfeeding confers robust benefits to offspring development in terms of growth, immunity, and neurophysiology. Similarly, improving environmental complexity, i.e., environmental enrichment (EE), contributes developmental advantages to both humans and laboratory animal models. However, the impact of environmental context on maternal care and milk quality has not been thoroughly evaluated, nor are the biological underpinnings of EE on offspring development understood. Here, Sprague Dawley rats were housed and bred in either EE or standard-housed (SD) conditions. EE dams gave birth to a larger number of pups, and litters were standardized and cross-fostered across groups on postnatal day (P)1. Maternal milk samples were then collected on P1 (transitional milk phase) and P10 (mature milk phase) for analysis. While EE dams spent less time nursing, postnatal enrichment exposure was associated with heavier offspring bodyweights. Milk from EE mothers had increased triglyceride levels, a greater microbiome diversity, and a significantly higher abundance of bacterial families related to bodyweight and energy metabolism. These differences reflected comparable transcriptomic changes at the genome-wide level. In addition to changes in lactational quality, we observed elevated levels of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the hypothalamus of EE dams, and sex-dependent and time-dependent effects of EE on offspring social behavior. Together, these results underscore the multidimensional impact of the combined neonatal and maternal environments on offspring development and maternal health. Moreover, they highlight potential deficiencies in the use of "gold standard" laboratory housing in the attempt to design translationally relevant animal models in biomedical research.</p>

                Education collaboration is important to increase the quality of human capital. South-South cooperation is conducted to exchange resources, technology, skills, and knowledge between southern countries. The purpose of this research is to investigate the collaboration between Indonesia and South Africa toward advancing South-South Cooperation in education. The data collection used in this qualitative research is an interview and literature study with 9 purposive informants from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Indonesia Ministry of Education and Culture, and the Embassy of South Africa. The data were obtained within six months. The interview was primarily used to explore the roles and practices of government institutions and universities in fostering education collaboration and human resources development. In this study, the South-South Cooperation helps Indonesia address its educational needs. The result showed that most international education cooperation between both countries is agreed upon at the University-to-University level through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), facing less sustainable challenges and low impact. Therefore, an investment-led model, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and a tool to monitor and evaluate this process are needed to improve South-South Cooperation to achieve its goals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Neuro-immunological complications post COVID-19 vaccination: two case reports [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To add to the growing literature regarding the possible link between the onset of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE) and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines. Case reports: The first patient is a 38-year-old man that presented muscle weakness and an unsteady gait for a duration of one week. Initially, he developed an unsteady gait, then gradually worsening generalized muscle fatigue and ascending weakness in all limbs. He tested positive for GM1 and GQ1D antibodies, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine with contrast and nerve conduction study (NCS) results were both suggestive of acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). The second patient is a 54-year-old man that developed generalized fatigue and subjective fever associated with headache and blurry vision followed by bulbar dysfunction. During hospitalization, his consciousness level started to be affected and he developed ataxia with ophthalmoparesis. A diagnosis of BBE was made based on clinical, imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. Conclusion: Since temporal relationships do not signify causation, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the association between COVID-19 vaccines and these neurological disorders. However, it is vital that new cases are reported so that the knowledge base is built upon, and to increase healthcare workers’ vigilance for early signs of GBS or BBE.

                Background: The standardization and mechanism of action of Caesalpinia sappan as an anticancer agent are still lacking. This study aimed to understand the mechanism of action of  C,sappan extract as an anticancer agent. Methods: This study was conducted using the A549 lung cancer cell line to understand the mechanism of action of C. sappan extract as an anticancer agent. The cytotoxicity activity, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, protein-related apoptosis (i.e., BCL-2and BAX protein) assays, and RNA sequencing were performed level were measured. Moreover, the antioxidant activity, total flavonoids, and phenolics of C.sappan were also assessed. Results: C.sappan has strong antioxidant activity (22.14 ± 0.93 ppm) total flavonoid content of (529.3 ± 4.56 mgQE/g), and phenolics content of (923.37 ± 5 mgGAE/g). The C.sappan ethanol extract inhibited cancer cell growth and arrested at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, inducing apoptosis by increasing BAX/BCL-2 protein ratio in A549 lung cancer cell line. Furthermore, results from RNA sequencing analysis showed that C.sappan ethanol extract caused downregulation of genes acting on mitochondrial function including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and respiration. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that C.sappan has the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in A549 cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Practical identifiability analysis of a mechanistic model for the time to distant metastatic relapse and its application to renal cell carcinoma</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arturo Álvarez-Arenas, Wilfried Souleyreau, Andrea Emanuelli, Lindsay S. Cooley, Jean-Christophe Bernhard, Andreas Bikfalvi, Sebastien Benzekry</p>

Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) curves are widely used in oncology. They are classically analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator or agnostic statistical models from survival analysis. Here we report on a method to extract more information from DMFS curves using a mathematical model of primary tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. The model depends on two parameters, <i>α</i> and <i>μ</i>, respectively quantifying tumor growth and dissemination. We assumed these to be lognormally distributed in a patient population. We propose a method for identification of the parameters of these distributions based on least-squares minimization between the data and the simulated survival curve. We studied the practical identifiability of these parameters and found that including the percentage of patients with metastasis at diagnosis was critical to ensure robust estimation. We also studied the impact and identifiability of covariates and their coefficients in <i>α</i> and <i>μ</i>, either categorical or continuous, including various functional forms for the latter (threshold, linear or a combination of both). We found that both the functional form and the coefficients could be determined from DMFS curves. We then applied our model to a clinical dataset of metastatic relapse from kidney cancer with individual data of 105 patients. We show that the model was able to describe the data and illustrate our method to disentangle the impact of three covariates on DMFS: a categorical one (Führman grade) and two continuous ones (gene expressions of the macrophage mannose receptor 1 (MMR) and the G Protein-Coupled Receptor Class C Group 5 Member A (GPRC5a)gene). We found that all had an influence in metastasis dissemination (<i>μ</i>), but not on growth (<i>α</i>).

Special sessions are important parts of scientific meetings and conferences: They gather together researchers and students interested in a specific topic and can strongly contribute to the success of the conference itself. Moreover, they can be the first step for trainees and students to the organization of a scientific event. Organizing a special session, however, can be uneasy for beginners and students. Here, we provide ten simple rules to follow to organize a special session at a scientific conference.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Constructive connectomics: How neuronal axons get from here to there using gene-expression maps derived from their family trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stan Kerstjens, Gabriela Michel, Rodney J. Douglas</p>

During brain development, billions of axons must navigate over multiple spatial scales to reach specific neuronal targets, and so build the processing circuits that generate the intelligent behavior of animals. However, the limited information capacity of the zygotic genome puts a strong constraint on how, and which, axonal routes can be encoded. We propose and validate a mechanism of development that can provide an efficient encoding of this global wiring task. The key principle, confirmed through simulation, is that basic constraints on mitoses of neural stem cells—that mitotic daughters have similar gene expression to their parent and do not stray far from one another—induce a global hierarchical map of nested regions, each marked by the expression profile of its common progenitor population. Thus, a traversal of the lineal hierarchy generates a systematic sequence of expression profiles that traces a staged route, which growth cones can follow to their remote targets. We have analyzed gene expression data of developing and adult mouse brains published by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, and found them consistent with our simulations: gene expression indeed partitions the brain into a global spatial hierarchy of nested contiguous regions that is stable at least from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56. We use this experimental data to demonstrate that our axonal guidance algorithm is able to robustly extend arbors over long distances to specific targets, and that these connections result in a qualitatively plausible connectome. We conclude that, paradoxically, cell division may be the key to uniting the neurons of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Archetypal Analysis for population genetics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julia Gimbernat-Mayol, Albert Dominguez Mantes, Carlos D. Bustamante, Daniel Mas Montserrat, Alexander G. Ioannidis</p>

The estimation of genetic clusters using genomic data has application from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to demographic history to polygenic risk scores (PRS) and is expected to play an important role in the analyses of increasingly diverse, large-scale cohorts. However, existing methods are computationally-intensive, prohibitively so in the case of nationwide biobanks. Here we explore Archetypal Analysis as an efficient, unsupervised approach for identifying genetic clusters and for associating individuals with them. Such unsupervised approaches help avoid conflating socially constructed ethnic labels with genetic clusters by eliminating the need for exogenous training labels. We show that Archetypal Analysis yields similar cluster structure to existing unsupervised methods such as ADMIXTURE and provides interpretative advantages. More importantly, we show that since Archetypal Analysis can be used with lower-dimensional representations of genetic data, significant reductions in computational time and memory requirements are possible. When Archetypal Analysis is run in such a fashion, it takes several orders of magnitude less compute time than the current standard, ADMIXTURE. Finally, we demonstrate uses ranging across datasets from humans to canids.

                We thank Selkoe and Cummings for their supportive words about our investigative reporting, but we disagree with their contention that the suspect work by Sylvain Lesné had minimal impact. The 2006 Nature paper discussed in the Letter—only one of nearly two dozen papers now in doubt—was cited at least 90 times annually as recently as 2021, according to Springer Nature. Over the past 5 years, Cummings and Selkoe continued to cite it and other work by Lesné on the amyloid-b (Aβ) Aβ*56 molecule. The story’s assertion that the suspect work may have misdirected other Alzheimer’s research was not ours alone; multiple experts in the field told us that it jump-started the search for soluble forms of amyloid-β that might explain neuron death and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s. Those efforts have not yielded any effective therapies to date. As for the broader amyloid hypothesis, to which both authors have devoted decades of effort, it does not depend on Lesné’s work, and our story quotes Selkoe to that effect. But the doubts about work that once seemed a milestone in the effort to link amyloid to cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s are surely a setback for the field.

                In his News story “Blots on a field?” (22 July, https://scim.ag/3T1evDh), C. Piller inaccurately describes my scientific thesis. He implied that my work has misled researchers in the Alzheimer’s disease field by encouraging the development of therapies targeting amyloid plaques, which are composed of amyloid beta protein (Aβ). Rather, for more than 20 years, I have consistently expressed concerns that drugs targeting plaques were not likely to be effective.

                As experienced researchers in the Alzheimer’s disease field, we have serious concerns about the News story “Blots on a field?” (C. Piller, 22 July, https://scim.ag/3T1evDh). The article summarizes the apparent manipulation of data in a 2006 study (1) and suggests that coauthor Sylvain Lesné committed egregious scientific misconduct when preparing figures supporting a central role for the specific amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, Aβ*56, in memory loss in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. Such investigative reporting is important to correct potential fraud. However, the article overstates and distorts the effect of this paper on the Alzheimer’s field.

    Abstract
   </h2>
   <div>
    The Radar Imager for Mars Subsurface Experiment instrument has conducted the first rover-mounted ground-penetrating radar survey of the Martian subsurface. A continuous radar image acquired over the Perseverance rover’s initial ~3-kilometer traverse reveals electromagnetic properties and bedrock stratigraphy of the Jezero crater floor to depths of ~15 meters below the surface. The radar image reveals the presence of ubiquitous strongly reflecting layered sequences that dip downward at angles of up to 15 degrees from horizontal in directions normal to the curvilinear boundary of and away from the exposed section of the Séitah formation. The observed slopes, thicknesses, and internal morphology of the inclined stratigraphic sections can be interpreted either as magmatic layering formed in a differentiated igneous body or as sedimentary layering commonly formed in aqueous environments on Earth. The discovery of buried structures on the Jezero crater floor is potentially compatible with a history of igneous activity and a history of multiple aqueous episodes.

    Abstract
   </h2>
   <div>
    Before Perseverance, Jezero crater’s floor was variably hypothesized to have a lacustrine, lava, volcanic airfall, or aeolian origin. SuperCam observations in the first 286 Mars days on Mars revealed a volcanic and intrusive terrain with compositional and density stratification. The dominant lithology along the traverse is basaltic, with plagioclase enrichment in stratigraphically higher locations. Stratigraphically lower, layered rocks are richer in normative pyroxene. The lowest observed unit has the highest inferred density and is olivine-rich with coarse (1.5 millimeters) euhedral, relatively unweathered grains, suggesting a cumulate origin. This is the first martian cumulate and shows similarities to martian meteorites, which also express olivine disequilibrium. Alteration materials including carbonates, sulfates, perchlorates, hydrated silicates, and iron oxides are pervasive but low in abundance, suggesting relatively brief lacustrine conditions. Orbital observations link the Jezero floor lithology to the broader Nili-Syrtis region, suggesting that density-driven compositional stratification is a regional characteristic.

                Background: SMEs have made a major contribution to the national economy, but Pandemic covid-19 made the decline of SMEs which directly affected the economy in Indonesia. The purpose of this research focus to explore the innovation of business models the novelty of the research model in the business model of innovation research models is to include the variable self-efficacy. This research emphasizes self-efficacy and Islamic financial literacy as independent variables, business model innovation as an intermediate model and business performance variables as dependent variables, with the focus of research on SMEs. Methods: This quantitative study uses partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and a questionnaire survey to analyze the 40 Street Vendors which is categorized as SMEs around Unisba. In the initial stages, the Questionnaire was tested with the Validity and Reliability test. In the PLS-SEM analysis, the validity of the indicators / items forming latent variables is based on the significance value of t arithmetic obtained from the loading factor value divided by the standard error. After being collected, the data is then processed and analyzed. The analytical method used in this study is the simultaneous equation model, namely Partial Least Square (PLS). The statistical tool used to test the hypothesis is Smart PLS. Results: The results showed that self-efficacy and Islamic financial literacy through business model innovation, had a positive effect on SMEs business performance simultaneously or partially.  Conclusion: So that by having good self-efficacy and good Islamic financial literacy plus an appropriate business innovation model, it will improve the business performance of SMEs.

                Background: This mixed-methods study was undertaken to ascertain undergraduate medical students’ perceptions of remote learning following the COVID-19 restrictions. 545 students participated in this study. Methods: Data was collected using a validated questionnaire and four focus group discussions. Results: Regarding recorded lectures, the quantitative findings indicated that they were important during online learning and the qualitative findings explained that the recorded lectures enabled individual students to pace and customize their learning. The majority of the students agreed that recorded lectures were relevant to their learning, though they watched less than 50% of recorded lectures. Qualitative findings described procrastination as the rationale for not watching the videos. The online live lectures had a relatively higher percentage of contribution towards learning in comparison with instructor recorded video lectures. Students were more engaged with live lectures, and 63.3% of respondents agreed. Qualitative findings confirmed the opportunities for interacting with peers and better clarification of doubts by teachers during live lectures. Conclusions: Online learning with recorded and live lectures provided continuity in medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. When compared to recorded video lectures, synchronous live lectures were regarded as superior by students largely due to the opportunity to directly communicate with the instructor and receive quick feedback.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The future of food and nutrition in ELIXIR [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Non-communicable diseases are on the rise and are often related to food choices; nutrition affects infectious diseases too. Therefore, there is growing interest in research on public and personal health, as related to food, nutrition behaviour and well-being of consumers throughout the life cycle. These concepts and their relations are complex and only partially understood – more data is needed to improve our understanding. The required data include deep geno- and phenotyping data from human nutritional studies, covering metabolic and health, but also including behavioural and socio-economic data. The aim of this white paper is to provide a guiding framework for the future contributions of ELIXIR’s recently established Food & Nutrition (F&N) Community. This white paper is the direct result of a strategy meeting that took place in September 2019 in The Hague (NL) and involved representatives of 14 countries representing the ELIXIR Nodes. The meeting led to the definition of F&N related bioinformatics challenges, including the use of standards for data reuse and sharing, and for interoperability of data, tools and services, advocacy and training. Resolving these bioinformatics challenges makes it possible to address a wide range of F&N-related challenges, such as definition of an individual health status, individual dietary needs, and finding complex intake biomarkers (to replace questionnaires). Here, we provide suggestions on how to align these tasks within the ELIXIR Platforms, other ELIXIR Communities/Focus Groups and the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures.

                <p>Nature Methods, Published online: 25 August 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01602-3">doi:10.1038/s41592-022-01602-3</a></p>Light microscopy enables researchers to observe cellular mechanisms with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the increasing complexity of current imaging technologies, coupled with financial constraints of potential users, hampers the general accessibility and potential reach of cutting-edge microscopy. Open microscopy can address this issue by making well-designed and well-documented hardware and software solutions openly available to a broad audience. In this Comment, we provide a definition of open microscopy and present recent projects in the field. We discuss current and future challenges of open microscopy and their implications for funders, policymakers, researchers and scientists. We believe that open microscopy requires a holistic approach. Sample preparation, designing and building of hardware components, writing software, data acquisition and data interpretation must go hand in hand to enable interdisciplinary and reproducible science to the benefit of society.

                Large-scale populations in the world have been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines, however, breakthrough infections of SARS-CoV-2 are still growing rapidly due to the emergence of immune-evasive variants, especially Omicron. It is urgent to develop effective broad-spectrum vaccines to better control the pandemic of these variants. Here, we present a mosaic-type trimeric form of spike receptor-binding domain (mos-tri-RBD) as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate, which carries the key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants. Tests in rats showed that the designed mos-tri-RBD, whether used alone or as a booster shot, elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against not only Omicron but also other immune-evasive variants. Neutralizing antibody ID50 titers induced by mos-tri-RBD were substantially higher than those elicited by homo-tri-RBD (containing homologous RBDs from prototype strain) or the BIBP inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). Our study indicates that mos-tri-RBD is highly immunogenic, which may serve as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate in combating SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Photoreceptors generate neuronal diversity in their target field through a Hedgehog morphogen gradient in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Defining the origin of neuronal diversity is a major challenge in developmental neurobiology. The <i>Drosophila</i> visual system is an excellent paradigm to study how cellular diversity is generated. Photoreceptors from the eye disc grow their axons into the optic lobe and secrete Hedgehog (Hh) to induce the lamina, such that for every unit eye there is a corresponding lamina unit made up of post-mitotic precursors stacked into columns. Each differentiated column contains five lamina neuron types (L1-L5), making it the simplest neuropil in the optic lobe, yet how this diversity is generated was unknown. Here, we found that Hh pathway activity is graded along the distal-proximal axis of lamina columns and further determined that this gradient in pathway activity arises from a gradient of Hh ligand. We manipulated Hh pathway activity cell-autonomously in lamina precursors and non-cell autonomously by inactivating the Hh ligand, and by knocking it down in photoreceptors. These manipulations showed that different thresholds of activity specify unique cell identities, with more proximal cell types specified in response to progressively lower Hh levels. Thus, our data establish that Hh acts as a morphogen to pattern the lamina. Although, this is the first such report during <i>Drosophila</i> nervous system development, our work uncovers a remarkable similarity with the vertebrate neural tube, which is patterned by Sonic Hedgehog. Altogether, we show that differentiating neurons can regulate the neuronal diversity of their distant target fields through morphogen gradients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In situ single particle classification reveals distinct 60S maturation intermediates in cells</a></h4>

              
                Previously we showed that high-resolution template matching can localize ribosomes in two-dimensional electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) images of untilted <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> cells with high precision (Lucas et al., 2021). Here we show that comparing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observed with 2DTM using different templates relative to the same cellular target can correct for local variation in noise and differentiate related complexes in focused ion beam (FIB)-milled cell sections. We use a maximum likelihood approach to define the probability of each particle belonging to each class, thereby establishing a statistic to describe the confidence of our classification. We apply this method in two contexts to locate and classify related intermediate states of 60S ribosome biogenesis in the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cell nucleus. In the first, we separate the nuclear pre-60S population from the cytoplasmic mature 60S population, using the subcellular localization to validate assignment. In the second, we show that relative 2DTM SNRs can be used to separate mixed populations of nuclear pre-60S that are not visually separable. 2DTM can distinguish related molecular populations without the need to generate 3D reconstructions from the data to be classified, permitting classification even when only a few target particles exist in a cell.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">GJA1 depletion causes ciliary defects by affecting Rab11 trafficking to the ciliary base</a></h4>

              
                The gap junction complex functions as a transport channel across the membrane. Among gap junction subunits, gap junction protein α1 (GJA1) is the most commonly expressed subunit. A recent study showed that GJA1 is necessary for the maintenance of motile cilia; however, the molecular mechanism and function of GJA1 in ciliogenesis remain unknown. Here, we examined the functions of GJA1 during ciliogenesis in human retinal pigment epithelium-1 and <i>Xenopus laevis</i> embryonic multiciliated-cells. GJA1 localizes to the motile ciliary axonemes or pericentriolar regions beneath the primary cilium. GJA1 depletion caused malformation of both the primary cilium and motile cilia. Further study revealed that GJA1 depletion affected several ciliary proteins such as BBS4, CP110, and Rab11 in the pericentriolar region and basal body. Interestingly, CP110 removal from the mother centriole was significantly reduced by GJA1 depletion. Importantly, Rab11, a key regulator during ciliogenesis, was immunoprecipitated with GJA1, and GJA1 knockdown caused the mislocalization of Rab11. These findings suggest that GJA1 regulates ciliogenesis by interacting with the Rab11-Rab8 ciliary trafficking pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An improved organ explant culture method reveals stem cell lineage dynamics in the adult Drosophila intestine</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, live-imaging techniques have been developed for the adult midgut of <i>Drosophila</i> <i>melanogaster</i> that allow temporal characterization of key processes involved in stem cell and tissue homeostasis. However, these organ culture techniques have been limited to imaging sessions of <span class="underline">&lt;</span>16 hours, an interval too short to track dynamic processes such as damage responses and regeneration, which can unfold over several days. Therefore, we developed an organ explant culture protocol capable of sustaining midguts <i>ex vivo</i> for up to 3 days. This was made possible by the formulation of a culture medium specifically designed for adult <i>Drosophila</i> tissues with an increased Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio and trehalose concentration, and by placing midguts at an air-liquid interface for enhanced oxygenation. We show that midgut progenitor cells can respond to gut epithelial damage <i>ex vivo</i>, proliferating and differentiating to replace lost cells, but are quiescent in healthy intestines. Using <i>ex vivo</i> gene induction to promote stem cell proliferation using <i>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></i> or <i>string</i> and <i>Cyclin E</i> overexpression, we demonstrate that progenitor cell lineages can be traced through multiple cell divisions using live imaging. We show that the same culture set-up is useful for imaging adult renal tubules and ovaries for up to 3 days and hearts for up to 10 days. By enabling both long-term imaging and real-time <i>ex vivo</i> gene manipulation, our simple culture protocol provides a powerful tool for studies of epithelial biology and cell lineage behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decomposing the role of alpha oscillations during brain maturation</a></h4>

              
                Childhood and adolescence are critical stages of the human lifespan, in which fundamental neural reorganizational processes take place. A substantial body of literature investigated accompanying neurophysiological changes, focusing on the most dominant feature of the human EEG signal: the alpha oscillation. Recent developments in EEG signal-processing show that conventional measures of alpha power are confounded by various factors and need to be decomposed into periodic and aperiodic components, which represent distinct underlying brain mechanisms. It is therefore unclear how each part of the signal changes during brain maturation. Using multivariate Bayesian generalized linear models, we examined aperiodic and periodic parameters of alpha activity in the largest openly available pediatric dataset (N=2529, age 5-22 years) and replicated these findings in a preregistered analysis of an independent validation sample (N=369, age 6-22 years). First, the welldocumented age-related decrease in total alpha power was replicated. However, when controlling for the aperiodic signal component, our findings provided strong evidence for an age-related increase in the aperiodic-adjusted alpha power. As reported in previous studies, also relative alpha power revealed a maturational increase, yet indicating an underestimation of the underlying relationship between periodic alpha power and brain maturation. The aperiodic intercept and slope decreased with increasing age and were highly correlated with total alpha power. Consequently, earlier interpretations on age-related changes of total alpha power need to be reconsidered, as elimination of active synapses rather links to decreases in the aperiodic intercept. Instead, analyses of diffusion tensor imaging data indicate that the maturational increase in aperiodic-adjusted alpha power is related to increased thalamocortical connectivity. Functionally, our results suggest that increased thalamic control of cortical alpha power is linked to improved attentional performance during brain maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Norepinephrine enhances oligodendrocyte precursor cell calcium dynamics in the cerebral cortex during arousal</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes are generated from a widely distributed population of progenitors that express neurotransmitter receptors, but the mechanisms that alter activity of these oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in vivo have not been determined. We generated a novel line of transgenic mice to express membrane-anchored GCaMP6s in OPCs and used longitudinal two-photon microscopy to monitor their calcium changes in the cerebral cortex of awake mice. OPCs exhibited high rates of spontaneous activity, consisting of focal, transient calcium increases within their highly ramified processes. Unexpectedly, these events occurred independent of excitatory neuron activity, but were inhibited by anesthesia, sedative agents, and antagonists of noradrenergic signaling. These norepinephrine enhanced calcium dynamics rapidly declined as with differentiation. Selective knockout of alpha-1A adrenergic receptors in OPCs suppressed both spontaneous and locomotion-induced calcium increases, indicating that OPCs are directly modulated by norepinephrine in vivo, providing a means to alter their dynamics and lineage progression during distinct brain states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neither sharpened or lost -- the unique role of attention in children's neural representations</a></h4>

              
                One critical feature of children's cognition is their relatively immature attention. Decades of research have shown that children's attentional abilities mature slowly over the course of development, including the ability to filter out distracting information. Despite such rich behavioral literature, little is known about how developing attentional abilities modulate neural representations in children. This information is critical to understanding exactly how attentional development shapes the way children process information. One intriguing possibility is that attention might be less likely to impact neural representations in children as compared with adults. In particular, representations of attended items may be less likely to be sharpened relative to unattended items in children as compared to adults. To investigate this possibility, we measured brain activity using fMRI while adults (21-31 years) and children (7-9 years) performed a one-back working memory task in which they were directed to attend to either motion direction or an object in a complex display where both were present. We used multivoxel pattern analysis and compared decoding accuracy of attended and unattended information. Consistent with attentional sharpening, we found higher decoding accuracy for task-relevant information (i.e., objects in the object-attended condition) than for task-irrelevant information (i.e., motion in the object-attended condition) in adults- visual cortices. However, in children's visual cortices, both task-relevant and task-irrelevant information were decoded equally well. What's more, exploratory whole-brain analysis showed that the children represent task-irrelevant information more than adults in multiple regions across the brain, including the prefrontal cortex. These findings show that 1) attention does not sharpen neural representations in the child visual cortex, and further 2) that the developing brain can represent more information than the adult brain.

                Cross-language data show that children with dyslexia are poor at recognizing syllable stress patterns, yet their speech production appears normal, suggesting an unexpected disconnect between speech input and output processes. Here we utilized a novel computerized speech copying task based on the speech amplitude envelope (AE) to investigate this disconnect. Seventy-five children with and without dyslexia copied familiar spoken targets like "Aladdin". Children with dyslexia were significantly worse at producing the multi-syllabic targets as indexed by two similarity metrics for computing the AE. They did not differ from other children in producing the pitch contours of items. Accordingly, impaired AE perception in dyslexia is matched by impaired AE production. Children with dyslexia are heard to produce multi-syllabic words normally because their pitch contours are intact.

                Cerebellar climbing fibers (CFs) convey sensorimotor information and their errors, which are used for motor control and learning. Furthermore, they represent reward-related information. Despite such functional diversity of CF signals, it is still unclear whether each CF conveys the information of single or multiple modalities and how the CFs conveying different information are distributed over the cerebellar cortex. We performed two-photon calcium imaging from cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) in mice engaged in a voluntary forelimb lever-pull task and demonstrated that CF responses in 93% of PCs could be explained by the combination of multiple behavioral variables, such as lever movement, licking, and reward delivery. Neighboring PCs exhibited similar CF response properties, formed functional clusters, and shared noise fluctuations of responses. Taken together, individual CFs convey behavioral information on multiplex variables and are spatially organized into the functional modules of the cerebellar cortex.

                De novo mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) in NRXN1 (2p16.3) pose a significant risk for schizophrenia (SCZ). How NRXN1 CNVs impact cortical development in a cell type-specific manner and how disease genetic background modulates these phenotypes are unclear. Here, we leveraged human pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoid models carrying NRXN1 heterozygous deletions in isogenic and SCZ patient genetic backgrounds and conducted single cell transcriptomic analysis over the course of cortical brain organoid development from 3 weeks to 3.5 months. We identified maturing glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons as being consistently impacted due to NRXN1 CNVs irrespective of genetic background, contributed in part by altered gene modules in ubiquitin-mediated pathways, splicing, and synaptic signaling. Moreover, while isogenic NRXN1 CNVs impact differentiation and maturation of neurons and astroglia, cell composition and developmental trajectories of early neural progenitors are affected in SCZ-NRXN1 CNVs. Our study reveals developmental timing dependent NRXN1 CNV-induced cellular mechanisms in SCZ at single cell resolution and highlights the emergence of disease-specific transcriptomic signatures and cellular vulnerabilities, which can arise from interaction between genetic variants and disease background.

                Progressive neurocognitive dysfunction is the leading cause of a reduced quality of life in patients with primary brain tumours. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments that occur in response to a brain tumour and its treatment is essential to improve patients' quality of life. Here, we show that normal-appearing non-tumour brain regions of patients with glioblastoma display hallmarks of accelerated ageing and share multiple features with Alzheimer's disease patients. Integrated transcriptomic and tissue analysis shows that normal-appearing brain tissue from glioblastoma patients has a significant overlap with brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients, revealing shared mitochondrial and neuronal dysfunction, and proteostasis deregulation. Overall, the brain of glioblastoma patients undergoes Alzheimer's disease-like accelerated ageing, providing novel or repurposed therapeutic targets for managing brain cancer-related side effects.

                Deep neural networks show great promise for classifying brain diseases and making prognostic assessments based on neuroimaging data, but large, labeled training datasets are often required to achieve high predictive accuracy. Here we evaluated a range of transfer learning or pre-training strategies to create useful MRI representations for downstream tasks that lack large amounts of training data, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification. To test our models, we analyzed 4,098 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and independently validated our proposed methods for detecting AD with an out-of-distribution test set of 600 scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS3) cohort. First, we trained 3D and 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We tested combinations of multiple pre-training strategies based on (1) supervised, (2) contrastive learning, and (3) self-supervised learning - using pre-training data within versus outside the MRI domain. In our experiments, the 3D CNN pre-trained with contrastive learning provided the best overall results - when fine-tuned on T1-weighted scans for AD classification - outperformed the baseline by 2.8% when trained with all of the training data from ADNI. We also show test performance as a function of the training dataset size and the chosen pre-training method. Transfer learning offered significant benefits in low data regimes, with a performance boost of 7.7%. When the pre-trained model was used for AD classification, we were able to visualize an improved clustering of test subjects' diagnostic groups, as illustrated via a uniform manifold approximation (UMAP) projection of the high-dimensional model embedding space. Further, saliency maps indicate the additional activation regions in the brain scan using pre-training, that then maximally contributed towards the final prediction score.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The kinesin motor KIF1C is a putative transporter of the exon junction complex in neuronal cells</a></h4>

              
                Neurons critically depend on regulated RNA localization and tight control of spatio-temporal gene expression to maintain their morphological and functional integrity. Mutations in the kinesin motor protein gene KIF1C cause Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, an autosomal recessive disease leading to predominant degeneration of the long axons of central motoneurons. In this study we aimed to gain insight into the molecular function of KIF1C and understand how KIF1C dysfunction contributes to motoneuron degeneration. We used affinity proteomics in neuronally differentiated neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) to identify the protein complex associated with KIF1C in neuronal cells; candidate interactions were then validated by immunoprecipitation and mislocalization of putative KIF1C cargoes was studied by immunostainings. We found KIF1C to interact with all core components of the exon junction complex (EJC); expression of mutant KIF1C in neuronal cells leads to loss of the typical localization distally in neurites. Instead, EJC core components accumulate in the pericentrosomal region, here co-localizing with mutant KIF1C. These findings suggest KIF1C as a neuronal transporter of the EJC. Interestingly, the binding of KIF1C to the EJC is RNA-mediated, as treatment with RNAse prior to immunoprecipitation almost completely abolishes the interaction. Silica-based solid-phase extraction of UV-crosslinked RNA-protein complexes furthermore supports direct interaction of KIF1C with RNA, as recently also demonstrated for kinesin heavy chain. Taken together, our findings are consistent with a model where KIF1C transports mRNA in an EJC-bound and therefore transcriptionally silenced state along neurites, thus providing the missing link between the EJC and mRNA localization in neurons.

                Impairments in the experience-dependent elaboration of neural circuits are assumed to underlie autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the phenotype underlying synaptic plasticity is poorly understood. Here, we used a valproic acid-induced ASD marmoset model and in vivo two-photon microscopy to investigate the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in ASD core symptoms. In model marmosets compared to controls, spine turnover was upregulated and spines were actively generated in clusters. Clustered emerging spines were predominant in carryover of generated spines in the model marmosets. Presynaptic boutons of local axons, but not long-range commissural axons, showed hyperdynamic turnover. Furthermore, nasal oxytocin administration reduced the clustered emergence of spines. Finally, we confirmed the high molecular conformity of adult animal models with human ASD. Our study suggests that an altered balance between synaptic plasticity and consolidation underlies ASD, and may be a potential therapeutic target.

                Vision requires that we rotate our eyes frequently to look at informative structures in the scene. Eye movements are planned by the brain but their execution depends on the mechanical properties of the oculomotor plant, i.e, the arrangement of eyeball position, muscle insertions and pulley locations. Therefore, the biomechanics of rotations is sensitive to eyeball translation because it changes muscle levers. Eyeball translations are little researched as they are difficult to measure with conventional techniques. Here we study the effects of eyeball translation on the coordination of gaze rotation by high-speed MRI recordings of saccadic eye movements during blinks, which are known to produce strong translations. We found that saccades during blinks massively overshoot their targets, and that these overshoots occur in a transient fashion such that the eye is back on target at the time the blink ends. These dynamic overshoots were tightly coupled to the eyeball translation, both in time and in size. Saccades made without blinks were also accompanied by small amounts of transient eyeball retraction, the size of which scaled with saccade amplitude. These findings demonstrate the complex interaction between rotation and translation movements of the eye. The mechanical consequences of eyeball translation on oculomotor control should be considered along with the neural implementation in the brain to understand the generation of eye movements and their disorders.

                The brain combines information from multiple sensory modalities to interpret the environment. These processes, collectively known as multisensory integration, have been modeled as ideal Bayesian causal inference, proposing that perception involves the combination of information from different sensory modalities based on their reliability and their likelihood of stemming from the same causes in the outside world. Bayesian causal inference has explained a variety of multisensory effects in simple tasks but is largely untested in complex sensory scenes where multisensory integration can provide the most benefit. Recently, we presented data challenging the ideal Bayesian model from a new auditory spatial discrimination task in which spatially aligned visual stimuli improve performance despite providing no information about the correct response. Here, we present two modifications of our original experiment to explore potential effects of the stimulus duration, and thus relative reliability of the stimuli, on the multisensory effect we previously measured. While our results replicate the original effect, we do not find clear evidence that the reliability of the stimuli impacts effect size within or across subjects.

                A maternal diet that provides adequate nutrition during pregnancy and lactation is vital to the neurodevelopment of offspring. One-carbon metabolism plays an important role in the closure of the neural tube of the developing embryo; however, the impact of maternal one-carbon dietary deficiencies on offspring neurological function later in life remains relatively unknown. Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, and its prevalence is expected to increase in younger age groups as the incidence of various risk factors for stroke increases. The aim of our study was to determine the impact of maternal nutritional deficiencies on cerebral blood flow and peripheral hemodynamics after ischemic stroke in adult offspring. In this study, adult female C57BL/6J mice were placed on either control (CD), choline (ChDD) or folic acid (FADD) deficient diets for four weeks to deplete stores prior to mating and maintained on the assigned diet during pregnancy and lactation. Female offspring were weaned and transitioned to a CD for the duration of the study. Ischemic stroke was induced in the sensorimotor cortex of 2- and 10-month-old female offspring using the photothrombosis model. Six weeks after induction of stroke, cerebral and peripheral blood flow was measured using the Vevo2100 Pulse Wave Doppler tracing modality. Our data showed that 3.5-month-old female offspring from a ChDD mothers had reduced blood flow in the posterior cerebral artery compared to CD mice; this effect disappeared in older offspring. In 11.5-month-old females we observed changes in peripheral hemodynamics, but not in young animals. Our findings suggest that a maternal dietary deficiency in choline results in reduced cerebral blood flow in adult female offspring after ischemic stroke, but the long-term effects are not present. This result points to the key role of the maternal diet in early life neuro-programming, while emphasizing its effects on both fetal development and long-term cerebrovascular health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Looking for a sign forecasting failure in actions: reaching errors triggered by a slowdown of movement and specific brain activity in preceding trials</a></h4>

              
                Even experts can sometimes fail while performing fully learned movements. Do such failures suddenly arise, or are there any forecasting signs? It has been reported that the kinematics of the early phase of movements can predict the failure, and brain activity patterns specific to failures are observed just before the movement onset. The presence of abnormal brain activity patterns long before (> 30 s) a failure in a cognitive task leads us to question if signs of a failure in action could exist in trials preceding the failure. Here, we examined this question using a reaching movement adaptation paradigm conventionally used to test motor learning dynamics. Firstly, the presence of a behavioral sign that preceded failures was observed: the peak velocity of the reaching movement significantly decreased in the preceding two trials. Secondly, specific theta and alpha band activity of EEG were observed in the failure trials and the trials preceding the failure. These results suggest that a failure in actions does not occur suddenly, and some signs preceding failures can be observed in the prior trials. Our approach may pave the way to investigate how we prevent failures and improve motor performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A dynamic sequence of visual processing initiated by gaze shifts</a></h4>

              
                Animals move their head and eyes as they explore and sample the visual scene. Previous studies have demonstrated neural correlates of head and eye movements in rodent primary visual cortex (V1), but the sources and computational roles of these signals are unclear. We addressed this by combining measurement of head and eye movements with high density neural recordings in freely moving mice. V1 neurons responded primarily to gaze shifts, where head movements are accompanied by saccadic eye movements, but not to head movements where compensatory eye movements stabilize gaze. A variety of activity patterns immediately followed gaze shifts, including units with positive, biphasic, or negative responses, and together these responses formed a temporal sequence following the gaze shift. These responses were greatly diminished in the dark for the vast majority of units, replaced by a uniform suppression of activity, and were similar to those evoked by sequentially flashed stimuli in head-fixed conditions, suggesting that gaze shift transients represent the temporal response to the rapid onset of new visual input. Notably, neurons responded in a sequence that matches their spatial frequency preference, from low to high spatial frequency tuning, consistent with coarse-to-fine processing of the visual scene following each gaze shift. Recordings in foveal V1 of freely gazing head-fixed marmosets revealed a similar sequence of temporal response following a saccade, as well as the progression of spatial frequency tuning. Together, our results demonstrate that active vision in both mice and marmosets consists of a dynamic temporal sequence of neural activity associated with visual sampling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Extremes of Normative Modelling</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we propose a new framework for understanding and modelling neurobiological extreme atypicalities for individual participants. We combine the strength of normative models, to make predictions for individual patients, with multivariate extreme value statistics, which allows us to model the outer centiles accurately, enabling accurate estimation of risk and detection of atypicality. In general, most statistical methods focus principally on estimating the mean of the distribution and are not appropriate to capture the tails of the distribution. We believe that the tails carry most of the information for predicting psychopathy in neurological and psychiatric disorders and should therefore be modelled carefully. In the univariate case, we demonstrate how to fit a generalized Pareto distribution with the peaks over threshold method. For the multivariate case, we present a novel framework that allows us to capture the multivariate tails of the distribution fully. The model relies on the so-called tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM). The TPDM is similar to a covariance matrix, but specified for the tails. From the TPDM we can create a reduced basis of vectors that explain most of the structure underlying the extreme values. The method is similar to covariance principal component analysis, but uniquely made for the extreme values. To evaluate this framework, we use a range of neuroimaging-derived measures from the UK Biobank dataset, including structural, functional and diffusion image-derived phenotypes. We find that the first extreme principal component mostly consists of whole-brain volume and area measures and the second extreme principal component is mostly compromised of white matter tracts. We further demonstrate the link between extreme brain deviations in the individual from a reference cohort to behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MicroRNA-218 instructs proper assembly of hippocampal networks</a></h4>

              
                The assembly of the mammalian brain is orchestrated by temporally coordinated waves of gene expression. A key aspect of this developmental program is mediated at the post-transcriptional level by microRNAs (miRNAs). Deletion of neuronal enriched miRNAs induces strong developmental phenotypes, and multiple reports have found altered levels of miRNAs in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms used by miRNAs to instruct proper brain development remain largely unexplored. Here, through multiple screens, we identified miR-218 as a critical regulator of hippocampal assembly in mice. MiR-218 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and enriched in both excitatory principal neurons and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Transient inhibition of miR-218 in early life results in an adult brain with heightened network activity and a predisposition to seizures. We used RNA-seq and FACS-seq (fluorescence-activated cell sorting followed by RNA-seq) to identify global and cell type-specific changes in gene expression in the absence of miR-218 and narrow down which altered developmental processes would lead to long-term network instability. We find that miR-218 inhibition results in the disruption of early depolarizing GABAergic signaling, structural defects in dendritic spines, and altered intrinsic membrane excitability. Finally, conditional knockout of miR-218 in interneurons, but not pyramidal neurons is sufficient to recapitulate the effects on long-term stability. Taken together, the data suggest that miR-218 orchestrates hippocampal network assembly to produce a stable network in the adult, primarily by regulating interneuron function in early postnatal life.

                Background: Chemosensory cues are vital for social and sexual behaviours and are primarily detected and processed by the vomeronasal system (VNS), whose plastic capacity has been investigated in mice. However, studying chemosensory plasticity outside of laboratory conditions may give a more realistic picture of how the VNS adapts to a changing environment. Rabbits are a well-described model of chemocommunication since the discovery of the rabbit mammary pheromone and their vomeronasal organ (VNO) transcriptome was recently characterized, a first step to further study plasticity-mediated transcriptional changes. In this study, we assess the plastic capacity of the rabbit male and female VNO under sex-separation vs sex-combined scenarios, including adults and juveniles, to determine whether the rabbit VNO is plastic and, if so, whether such plasticity is already established at early stages of life. Results: First, we characterized the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the VNO of rabbit male and female under sex-separation and compared it to sex-combined individuals, both in adults and juveniles, finding that differences between male and female were larger in a sex-separated scenario. Secondly, we analyzed the number of DEGs between sex-separated and sex-combined scenarios, both in males and females. In adults, both sexes showed a high number of DEGs while in juveniles only females showed differences. Additionally, the vomeronasal receptor genes were strikingly down-regulated in sex-separated adult females, whereas in juveniles up-regulation was shown for the same condition, suggesting a role of VRs in puberty onset. Finally, we described the environment-modulated plastic capacity of genes involved in reproduction, immunity and VNO functional activity, including G-protein coupled receptors. Conclusions: Our results show that sex-separation induces sex- and stage- specific gene expression differences in the VNO of male and female rabbit, both in adults and juveniles. These results bring out for the first time the plastic capacity of the rabbit VNO, supporting its functional adaptation to specifically respond to a continuous changing environment. Finally, species-specific differences and individual variability should always be considered in VNO studies and overall chemocommunication research.

                Spatial working memory and image recognition tests are commonly used to facilitate the diagnosis of hippocampal-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimers disease due to their relatively high specificity and sensitivity to damage to the medial temporal lobes compared to standard commonly used clinical tests. Pathological changes in Alzheimers disease start years before the formal diagnosis is made, partially due to testing too late. To address this challenge, we developed a novel digital platform, hAge (healthy Age), which integrates double spatial alternation, image recognition and visuospatial tasks for frequent remote unsupervised assessment of spatial and non-spatial working memory. 191 healthy adults (67% females, 18-81 years old) participated in the study. In line with findings using standard laboratory tests, we showed that performance on the spatial alternation task negatively correlated with inter-trial periods and performance levels on image recognition and visuospatial tasks can be controlled by varying image similarity. Importantly, we demonstrated that frequent engagement with the double spatial alternation task leads to a strong practice effect, previously identified as a potential measure of cognitive decline in MCI patients. Finally, we discuss how lifestyle and motivation confounds may present a serious challenge for cognitive assessment in real-world uncontrolled environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Screening Immunotherapy Targets to Counter Radiation-Induced Neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Galactic cosmic rays (GCR) in space induce increase in cerebral amyloid-{beta} levels and elevated levels of microgliosis and astrocytosis, causing accelerated neurodegeneration from this increased neuroinflammation. Even exposure to low-levels of high-Z high-energy (HZE) radiation (50 cGy) has been shown to induce biochemical and immunohistochemical changes in short-term leading to degradation in cognition, motor skills, and development of space-induced neuropathy. There is lack of effective neuroinflammation countermeasures, and current experimental therapies require invasive intracerebral and intrathecal delivery due to difficulty associated with therapeutic crossover between blood-brain barrier. Here, we present a new countermeasure development approach for neurotherapeutics using high-throughput drug-discovery, target validation, and lead molecule identification with nucleic acid-based molecules. These NanoligomerTM molecules are rationally designed using a bioinformatics and AI-based ranking method and synthesized as a single-modality combining 6-different design elements to up- or down-regulate gene expression of target gene at will, resulting in elevated or diminished protein expression of intended target. This platform approach was used to perturb and identify most effective upstream regulators and canonical pathways for therapeutic intervention to reverse radiation-induced neuroinflammation. The lead NanoligomerTM and corresponding target granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were identified using in vitro cell-based screening in human astrocytes and donor derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and further validated in vivo using a mouse model of radiation-induced neuroinflammation. GM-CSF transcriptional downregulator Nanoligomer 30D.443_CSF2 downregulated proinflammatory cytokine GM-CSF (or CSF2) using simple intraperitoneal injection of low-dose (3mg/kg) and completely reversed expression of CSF2 in cortex tissue, as well as other neuroinflammation markers. These results point to the broader applicability of this approach towards space countermeasure development, and potential for further investigation of lead neurotherapeutic molecule as a reversible gene therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Premorbid performances determine the deleterious effects of nigrostriatal degeneration and pramipexole on behavioural flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Subtle cognitive impairment can occur early in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) and may manifest under different forms of executive dysfunction such as impaired cognitive flexibility. The precise contribution of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration to these non-motor features of the disease is poorly known. Whether such cognitive impairment associated with the disease process may also predate and contribute to the development of neuropsychiatric side-effects following dopamine replacement therapy remains largely unknown. To address these issues, we investigated the respective contributions of nigrostriatal degeneration and chronic treatment with the dopamine D3-preferring agonist pramipexole on behavioural flexibility in a rat model of PD. Flexible, intermediate and inflexible rats were identified based on baseline assessment of behavioural flexibility using an operant set-shifting task. Nigrostriatal degeneration was induced by bilateral viral-mediated expression of A53T mutated human -synuclein in the substantia nigra pars compacta and behavioural flexibility was assessed after induction of nigrostriatal degeneration, and during chronic pramipexole treatment. Nigrostriatal degeneration impaired behavioural flexibility in flexible but not in inflexible rats. Pramipexole induced a decrease of behavioural flexibility that was exacerbated in lesioned rats and in the most flexible individuals. Furthermore, the deficits induced by pramipexole in lesioned rats affected different components of the task between flexible and inflexible individuals. This study demonstrates that nigrostriatal degeneration and pramipexole unequally impair behavioural flexibility, suggesting that the susceptibility to develop non-motor impairments upon treatment initiation could primarily depend on premorbid differences in behavioural flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Monocular deprivation during the critical period alters neuronal tuning and the composition of visual circuitry</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal visual experience during a developmental critical period degrades cortical responsiveness. Yet how experience-dependent plasticity alters the response properties of individual neurons and composition of visual circuitry is unclear. Here we measured with calcium imaging in alert mice how monocular deprivation (MD) during the developmental critical period affects binocularity, orientation, and spatial frequency tuning for neurons in primary visual cortex. Tracking the tuning properties for several hundred neurons revealed that the interconversion of monocular and binocular neurons relies on the quality of visual experience to determine the ratio of monocular neurons responsive to the contralateral and ipsilateral eye. In addition, a population of neurons more responsive to the closed eye were exchanged for neurons with tuning properties more similar to the responsive neurons altered by MD. Thus, plasticity during the critical period adapts to recent experience by both altering the tuning of responsive neurons and recruiting neurons with matching tuning properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensitivity to naturalistic texture relies primarily on high spatial frequencies</a></h4>

              
                Natural images contain information at multiple spatial scales. Although we understand how early visual mechanisms split multi-scale images into distinct spatial frequency channels, we do not know how the outputs of these channels are processed further by mid-level visual mechanisms. We have recently developed a naturalness discrimination task that uses synthesized, multi-scale textures to isolate these mid-level mechanisms (Freeman et. al. 2013). Here, we use three experimental manipulations (image blur, image rescaling, and eccentric viewing) to show that naturalness sensitivity is strongly dependent on image features at high object spatial frequencies (measured in cycles/image). As a result, sensitivity depends on a texture acuity limit, a property of the visual system that sets the highest retinal spatial frequency (measured in cycles/degree) that can be used to solve the task. A model observer analysis shows that high object spatial frequencies carry more task-relevant information than low object spatial frequencies. Comparing the outcome of this analysis with human performance reveals that human observers' efficiency is similar for all object spatial frequencies. We conclude that the mid-level mechanisms that underlie naturalness sensitivity effectively extract information from all image features below the texture acuity limit, regardless of their retinal and object spatial frequency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of DOT1L in a Screen for Factors that Promote Dopaminergic Neuron Survival</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra region of the midbrain. Diagnostic criteria for PD require that at least two of three motor signs are observed: tremor, rigidity, and/or bradykinesia. The most common and effective treatment for PD is Levodopa (L-DOPA) which is readily converted to DA and has been the primary treatment since the 1960s. Dopamine agonists have also been developed but are less effective than L-DOPA. Although the lack of a model system to study PD has hampered efforts to identify treatments, diverse screening strategies have been proposed for identification of new pharmaceutical candidates. Here, we describe a pilot screen to identify candidate molecules from a bioactive compound library, that might increase formation, maintenance and/or survival of DA neurons in vitro. The screen used a previously characterized reporter construct consisting of the luciferase gene inserted downstream of the endogenous tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene and neurons differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells for 18 days. The reporter mimics expression of TH and includes a secreted luciferase whose activity can be measured non-invasively over multiple timepoints. Screening of the bioactive compound library resulted in the identification of a single molecule, SGC0946, that is an inhibitor of DOT1L (Disruptor Of Telomeric silencing 1-Like) which encodes a widely-conserved histone H3K79 methyltransferase that is able to both activate and repress gene transcription. Our results indicate that SGC0946 increased reporter luciferase activity with a single treatment at 8-hours post-plating being equivalent to continuous treatment. Moreover, data suggested that the total number of neurons differentiated in the assays was comparable from experiment to experiment under different SGC0946 treatments over time. In contrast, data suggested that the survival and/or maintenance of DA neurons might be specifically enhanced by SGC0946 treatment. These results confirm other reports that indicate inhibition of DOT1L may play an important role in maintenance and survival of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and their lineage-specific differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RTNet: A neural network that exhibits the signatures of human perceptual decision making</a></h4>

              
                Convolutional neural networks currently provide the best models of biological vision. However, their decision behavior, including the facts that they are deterministic and use equal number of computations for easy and difficult stimuli, differs markedly from human decision-making, thus limiting their applicability as models of human perceptual behavior. Here we develop a new neural network, RTNet, that generates stochastic decisions and human-like response time (RT) distributions, and also reproduces all foundational features of human accuracy, RT, and confidence. To test RTNet's ability to predict human behavior on novel images, we collected accuracy, RT, and confidence data from 60 human subjects performing a digit discrimination task. We found that the accuracy, RT, and confidence produced by RTNet for individual novel images correlated with the same quantities produced by human subjects. Critically, human subjects who were more similar to the average human performance were also found to be closer to RTNet's predictions. Overall, RTNet is the first neural network that exhibits all basic signatures of perceptual decision making, and therefore provides the most detailed model of all critical features of human behavior for novel images.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling neural activity in neurodegenerative diseases through a neural field model with variable density of neurons.</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, a vertiginous advance has occurred within the Neural Field Theory with the development of the so-called Next Generation Neural Field models. Unlike the phenomenological models, these models manage to describe neuronal activity, macroscopically, from the thermodynamic limit of microscopic laws under the assumption of a homogeneous density of neurons. The study of neural activity during neurodegenerative processes associated to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Glioblastomas, should include a variable density of neurons. In this work, we propose an update of the Next Generation Neural Field model, extracted from the thermodynamic limit of the quadratic integration-and-fire model with realistic synaptic coupling and a variable density of neurons at the microscopic level. The thermodynamic limit of the system will allow us to study the patterns of synchronized neural activity that appear as the result of different spatial distribution of neurodegeneration. In particular, we demonstrate that during neurodegenerative processes, the relationship established between the thermodynamic states of the Neural Field and the Kuramoto order parameter (Measure of Neural Synchronization) differs from the classic results of the Next Generation Neural Field literature. Instead, the variation in neuron density directly modifies the Kuramoto order parameter. This might help us explain the diverse patterns of activity that can be found in different neurodegenerative processes and that could become experimental biomarkers of such pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Re-evaluating frontopolar and temporoparietal contributions to detection and discrimination confidence</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we identified a subset of regions where the relation between decision confidence and univariate fMRI activity was quadratic, with stronger activation for both high and low compared to intermediate levels of confidence. We further showed that, in a subset of these regions, this quadratic modulation appeared only for confidence in detection decisions about the presence or absence of a stimulus, and not for confidence in discrimination decisions about stimulus identity (Mazor, Friston & Fleming, 2021). Here, in a pre-registered follow-up experiment, we sought to replicate our original findings and identify the origins of putative detection-specific confidence signals by introducing a novel asymmetric-discrimination condition: a discrimination task with the signal-detection properties of a detection task. This task required discriminating two alternatives (two different grating tilts) but was engineered such that the distribution of perceptual evidence was asymmetric, just as in yes/no detection. We successfully replicated the quadratic modulation of subjective confidence in prefrontal, parietal and temporal cortices. However, in contrast to our original report, this quadratic effect was similar in detection and discrimination responses, but stronger in the novel asymmetric-discrimination condition. We interpret our findings as weighing against the detection-specificity of confidence signatures and speculate about possible alternative origins of a quadratic modulation of decision confidence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanisms of Dominant Electrophysiological Features of Four Subtypes of Layer 1 Interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Neocortical Layer 1 (L1) consists of GABAergic interneurons (INs) and receives extensive long-range "top down" projections, but L1 INs remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically examined the distinct dominant electrophysiological features for four unique IN subtypes in L1 that were previously identified: Canopy cells show an irregular firing pattern near rheobase; Neurogliaform cells (NGFCs) are late-spiking, and their firing rate accelerates during current injections; cells with strong expression of the 7 nicotinic receptor (7 cells), display initial (rebound) bursting; vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing cells exhibit high input resistance, strong adaptation, and irregular firing. Computational modelling revealed that these neurophysiological diverse features could be explained by an extended exponential-integrate-and-fire neuron model with varying contributions of a slowly inactivating K+ channel (SIK), a T-type Ca2+ channel, and a spike-triggered Ca2+-dependent K+ channel. In particular, we show that irregular firing results from square-wave bursting through a fast-slow analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that irregular firing is frequently observed in VIP cells due to the interaction between strong adaptation and a SIK channel. The reported findings of single neuron dynamics should be incorporated to elucidate how different L1 cell types contribute to the integration of top-down signaling and local processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying Optimal Neuroinflammation Treatment Using Nanoligomer Discovery Engine</a></h4>

              
                Acute activation of innate immune response in the brain, or neuroinflammation, protects this vital organ from a range of external pathogens and promotes healing after traumatic brain injury. However, chronic neuroinflammation leads to the activation of immune cells like microglia and astrocytes causes damage to the nervous tissue, and is causally linked to a range of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers diseases (AD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinsons diseases (PD), and many others. While neuroinflammation is a key target for a range of neuropathological diseases, there is a lack of effective countermeasures to tackle it, and existing experimental therapies require fairly invasive intracerebral and intrathecal delivery due to difficulty associated with the therapeutic crossover between the blood-brain barrier (BBB), making such treatments impractical to treat neuroinflammation long-term. Here, we present the development of an optimal neurotherapeutic using our NanoligomerTM discovery engine, by screening downregulation of several proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., Interleukin-1{beta} or IL-1{beta}, tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNF-, TNF receptor 1 or TNF-R1, Interleukin 6 or IL-6), inflammasomes (e.g., NLRP1), key transcription factors (e.g., nuclear factor kappa-B or NF-{kappa}{beta}) and their combinations, as upstream regulators and canonical pathway targets, to identify and validate the best-in-class treatment. Using our high-throughput drug discovery, target validation, and lead molecule identification using a bioinformatics and AI-based ranking method to design sequence-specific peptide molecules to up-or down-regulate gene expression of the targeted gene at will, we used our discovery engine to perturb and identify most effective upstream regulators and canonical pathways for therapeutic intervention to reverse neuroinflammation. The lead neurotherapeutic was a combination of NanoligomersTM targeted to NF-{kappa}{beta} (SB.201.17D.8_ NF-{kappa}{beta}1) and TNFR1 (SB.201.18D.6_TNFR1), which were identified using in vitro cell-based screening in donor-derived human astrocytes, and further validated in vivo using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. The combination treatment SB_NI_111 was delivered without any special formulation using a simple intraperitoneal injection of low-dose (5mg/kg) and was found to significantly suppress the expression of LPS-induced neuroinflammation in mouse hippocampus. These results point to the broader applicability of this approach towards the development of therapies for chronic neuroinflammation-linked neurodegenerative diseases, sleep countermeasures, and others, and the potential for further investigation of the lead neurotherapeutic molecule as reversible gene therapy.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with premature death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Previous studies have shown that astrocytes of PD patients may contribute to neuronal degeneration by mechanisms involving both direct cell-to-cell contact and transfer of soluble molecules. Since it has been proposed that PD patients exhibit an overall pro-inflammatory state, and since astrocytes are key mediators of the inflammation response in the brain, here we sought to address whether astrocyte-mediated inflammatory signaling could contribute to PD neuropathology. For this purpose, we generated astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) representing PD patients and healthy controls. Transcriptomic analyses identified a unique inflammatory gene expression signature in PD astrocytes compared to controls. In particular, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was found to be highly expressed and released by PD astrocytes, and to induce toxicity in dopamine neurons. Mechanistically, neuronal cell death was mediated by IL-6 signaling via IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expressed in human PD neurons, leading to downstream activation of STAT3. Importantly, astrocyte-induced cell death in PD disease midbrain neurons could be prevented by blocking IL6R-mediated signaling using clinically available antibodies. Moreover, examination of postmortem tissue brain of early-stage PD patients uncovered increased numbers of dopamine neurons overexpressing IL-6R and of reactive astrocytes overexpressing IL-6, compared to healthy brains. Our findings highlight the potential role of astrocyte-mediated inflammatory signaling in neuronal loss in PD, and open the way for new therapies based on IL-6 immunomodulation for preventing PD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting default mode network connectivity with mindfulness-based fMRI neurofeedback: A pilot study among adolescents with affective disorder history</a></h4>

              
                Adolescents experience alarmingly high rates of major depressive disorder (MDD), however, gold-standard treatments are only effective for ~50% of youth. Accordingly, there is a critical need to develop novel interventions, particularly ones that target neural mechanisms believed to potentiate depressive symptoms. Directly addressing this gap, we developed a mindfulness-based fMRI neurofeedback (mbNF) for adolescents that targets default mode network (DMN) hyperconnectivity, which has been implicated in the onset and maintenance of MDD. In this proof-of-concept study, adolescents (n = 9) with a lifetime history of depression and/or anxiety were administered clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires, and then, each participant's DMN and central executive network (CEN) were personalized using a resting state fMRI localizer. After the localizer scan, adolescents completed a brief mindfulness training followed by a mbNF session in the scanner wherein they were instructed to volitionally reduce DMN relative to CEN activation by practicing mindfulness meditation. Several promising findings emerged. First, mbNF successfully engaged the target brain state during neurofeedback; participants spent more time in the target state with DMN activation lower than CEN activation. Second, in each of the nine adolescents, mbNF led to significantly reduced within-DMN connectivity, which correlated with post-mbNF increases in state mindfulness. Last, a reduction of within-DMN connectivity mediated the association between better mbNF performance and increased state mindfulness. These findings demonstrate that personalized mbNF can effectively and non-invasively modulate the intrinsic networks known to be associated with the emergence and persistence of depressive symptoms during adolescence.

	<p>BACKGROUND: Over the past few years, there has been an increasing interest in viewing the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) through the lens of the biopsychosocial model. However, other than a few epidemiological surveys, there is a dearth of studies from emerging economies that have examined FH using the biological, psychological, and socio-environmental facets of the aforementioned model. AIM. The three aims of the current study were as follows: (i) to examine the psychosocial status among patients with genetically confirmed FH, (ii) to compare their intellectual capacity and cognitive outcomes with a reference group, and (iii) to examine the relationship between health literacy and cognitive functioning. METHOD: Consecutive FH patients referred to the lipid clinic at a tertiary care center for an expert opinion were recruited into this study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Information regarding psychosocial functioning, health literacy, quality of life, and affective ranges was surveyed. Indices of current reasoning ability and cognition (attention and concentration, memory, and executive functioning) were compared with a socio-demographically-matched reference group. The current hypothesis also explored the impact of FH on health literacy and cognition. RESULT: A total of 70 participants out of 106 (response rate: 66.0%) initially agreed to participate. However, 18 out of 70 dropped out of the study, yielding a final total of 52 FH patients. With 27 (51.9%) males and 25 (48.1%) females, the mean participant age stood at 37.2 years (SD = 9.2), ranging from 21 to 52 years of age. In the psychosocial data, thirty-two percent (n = 17) of them had anxiety (HADS &amp;amp;ge; 8), and twenty-five percent (n = 13) had depressive symptoms (HADS &amp;amp;ge; 8). The performance of the FH patients was significantly impaired compared to the control group on the indices of current reasoning ability and all domains of cognitive functioning. In the univariate analysis conducted to compare cognitive functioning with health literacy status, only indices of attention and concentration emerged as being significant. CONCLUSION: The current study indicates that the FH population is marked with impediments in biopsychosocial functioning, including indices tapping into the integrity of health literacy, quality of life, affective ranges, and higher functioning such as cognition and current reasoning ability when compared with a socio-demographically-matched reference group. The present results support the hypothesis that chronic diseases vis-&amp;amp;agrave;-vis the sequelae of coronary artery disease can potentially impede biopsychosocial functioning.</p>

	<p>Using behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures, the present study examined whether eye gaze triggers a unique form of attentional orienting toward threat-relevant targets. A threatening or neutral target was presented after a non-predictive gaze or an arrow cue. In Experiment 1, reaction times indicated that eye gaze and arrow cues triggered different attention orienting towards threatening targets, which was confirmed by target-elicited P3b latency in Experiment 2. Specifically, for targets preceded by arrow and gaze cues, P3b peak latency was shorter for neutral targets than threatening targets. However, the latency differences were significantly smaller for gaze cues than for arrow cues. Moreover, target-elicited N2 amplitude indicated a significantly stronger cue validity effect of eye gaze than that of arrows. These findings suggest that eye gaze uniquely triggers spatial attention orienting to socially threatening information.</p>

	<p>The prediction of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) progression plays a very important role in the early intervention of patients and the improvement of life quality. Cognitive scales are commonly used to assess the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s status. However, due to the complicated pathogenesis of AD and the individual differences in AD, the prediction of AD progression is challenging. This paper proposes a novel coupling model (P-E model) that takes into account the processes of physiological degradation and emotional state transition of AD patients. We conduct experiments on synthetic data to validate the effectiveness of the proposed P-E model. Next, we conduct experiments on 134 subjects with more than 10 follow-ups from the Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The prediction performance of the P-E model is significantly better than other state-of-the-art methods, which achieves the mean squared error of 7.137 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.035. The experimental results show that the P-E model can well characterize the non-monotonic properties of AD cognitive data and can also have a good predictive ability for time series data with individual differences.</p>

	<p>One of the proposed neural mechanisms involved in working memory is coupling between the theta phase and gamma amplitude. For example, evidence from intracranial recordings shows that coupling between hippocampal theta and cortical gamma oscillations increases selectively during working memory tasks. Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling can also be measured non-invasively through scalp EEG; however, EEG can only assess coupling within cortical areas, and it is not yet clear if this cortical-only coupling is truly memory-specific, or a more general phenomenon. We tested this directly by measuring cortical coupling during three different conditions: a working memory task, an attention task, and a passive perception condition. We find similar levels of theta-gamma coupling in all three conditions, suggesting that cortical theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling is not a memory-specific signal, but instead reflects some other attentional or perceptual processes. Implications for understanding the brain dynamics of visual working memory are discussed.</p>

	<p>Appropriate head models for cortical source analysis were investigated and applied to source analyses examining the neural bases of the face-sensitive N290 event-related potential (ERP) component in infants at high risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This included infant siblings of children with ASD (ASIBs) and infants with fragile X syndrome (FXS). First, alternative head models for use with ASIBs and FXS were investigated. Head models created from the infant&amp;amp;rsquo;s own MRI were examined in relation to five head models based on average MRI templates. The results of the head model comparison identified group-specific (i.e., ASIB or FXS) head models created from a large collection of structural MRIs as the best substitution for the head model created from the participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s own structural MRI. Second, the cortical source analysis was completed on N290 data collected from a previous study to investigate brain areas associated with face sensitive ERP responses. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; own MRIs were used for head models when available, and the group-specific head model was used when the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; own MRIs were not available. The results provide evidence for unique patterns of neural activation during face processing across infants at high and low risk for ASD and across etiologically distinct high-risk groups. All infants demonstrated greater activation to faces than toys in brain areas most associated with specialized face processing. Infants with FXS displayed higher levels of activation to faces across all areas analyzed, while ASIBs show more muted levels of activation. Overall, the results of the current study demonstrate the importance of group-specific head models for accurate cortical source analysis in infants at high risk for ASD. This also allows for further research on early distinctions in brain function based on risk status.</p>

	<p>The rapidly expanding spectrum of autoimmune encephalitis in the last fifteen years is largely due to ongoing discovery of many neuronal autoantibodies. The diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis can be challenging due to the wide spectrum of clinical presentations, prevalence of psychiatric features that mimic primary psychiatric illnesses, frequent absence of diagnostic abnormalities on conventional brain MR-imaging, non-specific findings on EEG testing, and the lack of identified IgG class neuronal autoantibodies in blood or CSF in a subgroup of patients. Early recognition and treatment are paramount to improve outcomes and achieve complete recovery from these debilitating, occasionally life threatening, disorders. This review is aimed to provide primary care physicians and hospitalists who, together with neurologist and psychiatrists, are often the first port of call for individuals presenting with new-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms, with up-to-date data and evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders of suspected autoimmune origin.</p>

	<p>Adolescent depression is prevalent, debilitating, and associated with chronic lifetime mental health disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of depression is critical to developing novel treatments. We tested a neurofeedback protocol targeting emotional regulation and self-processing circuitry and examined brain activity associated with reduced symptom severity, as measured through self-report questionnaires, four hours after neurofeedback. Depressed (n = 34) and healthy (n = 19) adolescents participated in (i) a brief neurofeedback task that involves simultaneously viewing their own happy face, recalling a positive autobiographical memory, and increasing amygdala-hippocampal activity; (ii) a self- vs. other- face recognition task with happy, neutral, and sad facial expressions before and after the neurofeedback. In depressed youth, reduced depression after neurofeedback was associated with increased self-referential and visual areas&amp;amp;rsquo; activity during neurofeedback, specifically, increased activity in the cuneus, precuneus and parietal lobe. Reduced depression was also associated with increased activation of emotional regulation and cross-modal areas during a self-recognition task. These areas included the cerebellum, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus. However, decreased rumination was linked to decreased precuneus, angular and temporal gyri activity during neurofeedback. These results tentatively suggest that neurofeedback may induce short-term neurobiological changes in the self-referential and emotional regulation networks associated with reduced symptom severity among depressed adolescents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neurofilament Transport Is Bidirectional In Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurofilaments are abundant space-filling cytoskeletal polymers that are transported into and along axons. During postnatal development, these polymers accumulate in myelinated axons causing an expansion of axon caliber, which is necessary for rapid electrical transmission. Studies on cultured nerve cells have shown that axonal neurofilaments move rapidly and intermittently along microtubule tracks in both anterograde and retrograde directions. However, it is unclear whether neurofilament transport is also bidirectional <I>in vivo</I>. Here, we describe a pulse-spread fluorescence photoactivation method to address this in peripheral nerves dissected from <I>hThy1-paGFP-NFM</I> transgenic mice, which express a photoactivatable fluorescent neurofilament protein. Neurofilaments were photoactivated in short segments of myelinated axons in tibial nerves at 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of age. The proximal and distal spread of the fluorescence due to the movement of the fluorescent neurofilaments was measured over time. We show that the directional bias and velocity of neurofilament transport can be calculated from these measurements. The directional bias was ~60% anterograde and 40% retrograde and did not change significantly with age or distance along the nerve. The net velocity decreased with age and distance along the nerve, which is consistent with previous studies using radioisotopic pulse labeling. This decrease in velocity was caused by a decrease in both anterograde and retrograde movement. Thus, neurofilament transport is bidirectional <I>in vivo</I>, with a significant fraction of the filaments moving retrogradely in both juvenile and adult mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Multiple Calcium Channel Types with Unique Expression Patterns Mediate Retinal Signaling at Bipolar Cell Ribbon Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Retinal bipolar cells (BCs) compose the canonical vertical excitatory pathway that conveys photoreceptor output to inner retinal neurons. Although synaptic transmission from BC terminals is thought to rely almost exclusively on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>) channels mediating L-type currents, the molecular identity of Ca<SUB>V</SUB> channels in BCs is uncertain. Therefore, we combined molecular and functional analyses to determine the expression profiles of Ca<SUB>V</SUB> &alpha;<SUB>1</SUB>, &beta;, and &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB> subunits in mouse rod bipolar (RB) cells, BCs from which the dynamics of synaptic transmission are relatively well-characterized. We found significant heterogeneity in Ca<SUB>V</SUB> subunit expression within the RB population from mice of either sex, and significantly, we discovered that transmission from RB synapses was mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through P/Q-type (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.1) and N-type (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2) conductances as well as the previously-described L-type (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1) and T-type (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>3) conductances. Furthermore, we found both Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.3 and Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.4 proteins located near presynaptic ribbon-type active zones in RB axon terminals, indicating that the L-type conductance is mediated by multiple Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1 subtypes. Similarly, Ca<SUB>V</SUB>3 &alpha;<SUB>1</SUB>, &beta;, and &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB> subunits also appear to obey a "multisubtype" rule, i.e., we observed a combination of multiple subtypes, rather than a single subtype as previously thought, for each Ca<SUB>V</SUB> subunit in individual cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">JUN Regulation of Injury-Induced Enhancers in Schwann Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Schwann cells play a critical role after peripheral nerve injury by clearing myelin debris, forming axon-guiding bands of Bu&#x0308;ngner, and remyelinating regenerating axons. Schwann cells undergo epigenomic remodeling to differentiate into a repair state that expresses unique genes, some of which are not expressed at other stages of Schwann cell development. We previously identified a set of enhancers that are activated in Schwann cells after nerve injury, and we determined whether these enhancers are preprogrammed into the Schwann cell epigenome as poised enhancers before injury. Poised enhancers share many attributes of active enhancers, such as open chromatin, but are marked by repressive histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation rather than H3K27 acetylation. We find that most injury-induced enhancers are not marked as poised enhancers before injury indicating that injury-induced enhancers are not preprogrammed in the Schwann cell epigenome. Injury-induced enhancers are enriched with AP-1 binding motifs, and the c-JUN subunit of AP-1 had been shown to be critical to drive the transcriptional response of Schwann cells after injury. Using <I>in vivo</I> chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis in rat, we find that c-JUN binds to a subset of injury-induced enhancers. To test the role of specific injury-induced enhancers, we focused on c-JUN-binding enhancers upstream of the <I>Sonic hedgehog</I> (<I>Shh</I>) gene, which is only upregulated in repair Schwann cells compared with other stages of Schwann cell development. We used targeted deletions in male/female mice to show that the enhancers are required for robust induction of the <I>Shh</I> gene after injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The proregenerative actions of Schwann cells after nerve injury depends on profound reprogramming of the epigenome. The repair state is directed by injury-induced transcription factors, like JUN, which is uniquely required after nerve injury. In this study, we test whether the injury program is preprogrammed into the epigenome as poised enhancers and define which enhancers bind JUN. Finally, we test the roles of these enhancers by performing clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&ndash;mediated deletion of JUN-bound injury enhancers in the <I>Sonic hedgehog</I> gene. Although many long-range enhancers drive expression of <I>Sonic hedgehog</I> at different developmental stages of specific tissues, these studies identify an entirely new set of enhancers that are required for <I>Sonic hedgehog</I> induction in Schwann cells after injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">An ErbB4-Positive Neuronal Network in the Olfactory Bulb for Olfaction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Olfactory information is relayed and processed in the olfactory bulb (OB). Mitral cells, the principal output excitatory neurons of the OB, are controlled by multiple types of interneurons. However, mechanisms that regulate the activity of OB interneurons are not well understood. We provide evidence that the transmembrane tyrosine kinase ErbB4 is selectively expressed in subsets of OB inhibitory neurons in both male and female mice. ErbB4-positive (ErbB4<sup>+</sup>) neurons are mainly located in the glomerular layer (GL) and granule cell layer (GCL) and do not express previously defined markers. Optogenetic activation of GL-ErbB4<sup>+</sup> neurons promotes theta oscillation, whereas activation of those in the GCL generates  oscillations. Stimulation of OB slices with NRG1, a ligand that activates ErbB4, increases GABA transmission onto mitral cells, suggesting a role of OB NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in olfaction. In accord, ErbB4 mutant mice or acute inhibition of ErbB4 by a chemical genetic approach diminishes GABA transmission, reduces bulbar local field potential power, increases the threshold of olfactory sensitivity, and impairs odor discrimination. Together, these results identified a bulbar inhibitory network of ErbB4<sup>+</sup> neurons for olfaction. Considering that both <I>Nrg1</I> and <I>Erbb4</I> are susceptibility genes for neuropsychiatric disorders, our study provides insight into pathologic mechanisms of olfactory malfunctions in these disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study demonstrates that ErbB4<sup>+</sup> neurons are a new subset of olfactory bulb inhibitory neurons in the glomerular layer and granule cell layer that innervate mitral cells and ErbB4<sup>&ndash;</sup> cells. They regulate olfaction by controlling local synchrony and distinct oscillations. ErbB4 inhibition diminishes GABA transmission, reduces bulbar local field potential power, increases the threshold of olfactory sensitivity, and impairs odor discrimination. Our results provide insight into pathophysiological mechanism of olfaction deficits in brain disorders associated with <I>Nrg1</I> or <I>Erbb4</I> mutations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Mechanisms Underlying Temporally Precise Information Processing in the VNLL, an Auditory Brainstem Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Large glutamatergic, somatic synapses mediate temporally precise information transfer. In the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, an auditory brainstem nucleus, the signal of an excitatory large somatic synapse is sign inverted to generate rapid feedforward inhibition with high temporal acuity at sound onsets, a mechanism involved in the suppression of spurious frequency information. The mechanisms of the synaptically driven input&ndash;output functions in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus are not fully resolved. Here, we show in Mongolian gerbils of both sexes that, for stimulation frequencies up to 200 Hz, the EPSC kinetics together with short-term plasticity allow for faithful transmission with only a small increase in latency. Glutamatergic currents are exclusively mediated by AMPARs and NMDARs. Short-term plasticity is frequency-dependent and composed of an initial facilitation followed by depression. Physiologically relevant output generation is limited by the decrease in synaptic conductance through short-term plasticity (STP). At this endbulb synapse, STP acts as a low pass filter and increases the dynamic range of the conductance dependent input&ndash;output relation, while NMDAR signaling slightly increases the sensitivity of the input&ndash;output function. Our computational model shows that STP-mediated filtering limits the intensity dependence of the spike output, thus maintaining selectivity to sound transients. Our results highlight the interaction of cellular features that together give rise to the computations in the circuit.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Auditory information processing in the brainstem is a prerequisite for generating our auditory representation of the environment. Thereby, many processing steps rely on temporally precise filtering. Precise feedforward inhibition is a key motif in auditory brainstem processing and produced through sign inversion at several large somatic excitatory synapses. A particular feature of the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus is to produce temporally precise onset inhibition with little temporal variance independent of sound intensity. Our cell-physiology and modeling data explain how the synaptic characteristics of different current components and their short-term plasticity are tuned to establish sound intensity-invariant onset inhibition that is crucial for filtering out spurious frequency information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">State-Dependent Modulation of Activity in Distinct Layer 6 Corticothalamic Neurons in Barrel Cortex of Awake Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6 CT) neurons are in a strategic position to control sensory input to the neocortex, yet we understand very little about their functions. Apart from studying their anatomic, physiological, and synaptic properties, most recent efforts have focused on the activity-dependent influences CT cells can exert on thalamic and cortical neurons through causal optogenetic manipulations. However, few studies have attempted to study them during behavior. To address this gap, we performed juxtacellular recordings from optogenetically identified CT neurons in whisker-related primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) of awake, head-fixed mice (either sex) free to rest quietly or self-initiate bouts of whisking and locomotion. We found a rich diversity of response profiles exhibited by CT cells. Their spiking patterns were either modulated by whisking-related behavior (~28%) or not (~72%). Whisking-responsive neurons exhibited both increases (activated-type) and decreases in firing rates (suppressed-type) that aligned with whisking onset better than locomotion. We also encountered responsive neurons with preceding modulations in firing rate before whisking onset. Overall, whisking better explained these changes in rates than overall changes in arousal. Whisking-unresponsive CT cells were generally quiet, with many having low spontaneous firing rates (sparse-type) and others being completely silent (silent-type). Remarkably, the sparse firing CT population preferentially spiked at the state transition point when pupil diameter constricted, and the mouse entered quiet wakefulness. Thus, our results demonstrate that L6 CT cells in wS1 show diverse spiking patterns, perhaps subserving distinct functional roles related to precisely timed responses during complex behaviors and transitions between discrete waking states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons provide a massive input to the sensory thalamus and local connectivity within cortex, but their role in thalamocortical processing remains unclear because of difficulty accessing and isolating their activity. Although several recent optogenetic studies reveal that the net influence of corticothalamic actions, suppression versus enhancement, depends critically on the rate these neurons fire, the factors that influence their spiking are poorly understood, particularly during wakefulness. Using the well-established <I>Ntsr1-Cre</I> line to target this elusive population in the whisker somatosensory cortex of awake mice, we found that corticothalamic neurons show diverse state-related responses and modulations in firing rate. These results suggest separate corticothalamic populations can differentially influence thalamocortical excitability during rapid state transitions in awake, behaving animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Left-Right Locomotor Coordination in Human Neonates</a></h4>

              
                <p>Terrestrial locomotion requires coordinated bilateral activation of limb muscles, with left&ndash;right alternation in walking or running, and synchronous activation in hopping or skipping. The neural mechanisms involved in interlimb coordination at birth are well known in different mammalian species, but less so in humans. Here, 46 neonates (of either sex) performed bilateral and unilateral stepping with one leg blocked in different positions. By recording EMG activities of lower-limb muscles, we observed episodes of left&ndash;right alternating or synchronous coordination. In most cases, the frequency of EMG oscillations during sequences of consecutive steps was approximately similar between the two sides, but in some cases it was considerably different, with episodes of 2:1 interlimb coordination and episodes of activity deletions on the blocked side. Hip position of the blocked limb significantly affected ipsilateral, but not contralateral, muscle activities. Thus, hip extension backward engaged hip flexor muscle, and hip flexion engaged hip extensors. Moreover, the sudden release of the blocked limb in the posterior position elicited the immediate initiation of the swing phase of the limb, with hip flexion and a burst of an ankle flexor muscle. Extensor muscles showed load responses at midstance. The variable interlimb coordination and its incomplete sensory modulation suggest that the neonatal locomotor networks do not operate in the same manner as in mature locomotion, also because of the limited cortical control at birth. These neonatal mechanisms share many properties with spinal mammalian preparations (i.e., independent pattern generators for each limb, and for flexor and extensor muscles, load, and hip position feedback).</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bilateral coupling and reciprocal activation of flexor and extensor burst generators represent the fundamental mechanisms used by mammalian limbed locomotion. Considerable progress has been made in deciphering the early development of the spinal networks and left&ndash;right coordination in different mammals, but less is known about human newborns. We compared bilateral and unilateral stepping in human neonates, where cortical control is still underdeveloped. We found neonatal mechanisms that share many properties with spinal mammalian preparations (i.e., independent pattern generators for each limb, the independent generators for flexor and extensor muscles, load, and hip-position feedback. The variable interlimb coordination and its incomplete sensory modulation suggest that the human neonatal locomotor networks do not operate in the same manner as in mature locomotion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contingent Amygdala Inputs Trigger Heterosynaptic LTP at Hippocampus-To-Accumbens Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) is a key brain region where environmental cues acquire incentive salience to reinforce motivated behaviors. Principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAcSh receive extensive glutamatergic projections from limbic regions, among which, the ventral hippocampus (vH) transmits information enriched in contextual cues, and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) encodes real-time arousing states. The vH and BLA project convergently to NAcSh MSNs, both activated in a time-locked manner on a cue-conditioned motivational action. In brain slices prepared from male and female mice, we show that co-activation of the two projections induces long-term potentiation (LTP) at vH-to-NAcSh synapses without affecting BLA-to-NAcSh synapses, revealing a heterosynaptic mechanism through which BLA signals persistently increase the temporally contingent vH-to-NAcSh transmission. Furthermore, this LTP is more prominent in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing (D1) MSNs than D2 MSNs and can be prevented by inhibition of either D1 receptors or dopaminergic terminals in NAcSh. This heterosynaptic LTP may provide a dopamine-guided mechanism through which vH-encoded cue inputs that are contingent to BLA activation acquire increased circuit representation to reinforce behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In motivated behaviors, environmental cues associated with arousing stimuli acquire increased incentive salience, processes mediated in part by the nucleus accumbens (NAc). NAc principal neurons receive glutamatergic projections from the ventral hippocampus (vH) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), which transmit information encoding contextual cues and affective states, respectively. Our results show that co-activation of the two projections induces long-term potentiation (LTP) at vH-to-NAc synapses without affecting BLA-to-NAc synapses, revealing a heterosynaptic mechanism through which BLA signals potentiate the temporally contingent vH-to-NAc transmission. Furthermore, this LTP is prevented by inhibition of either D1 receptors or dopaminergic axons. This heterosynaptic LTP may provide a dopamine-guided mechanism through which vH-encoded cue inputs that are contingent to BLA activation acquire increased circuit representation to reinforce behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Threat Reactivity Interacts with Physiological Arousal to Predict PTSD Symptoms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippo campal impairments are reliably associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, little research has characterized how increased threat sensitivity may interact with arousal responses to alter hippocampal reactivity, and further how these interactions relate to the sequelae of trauma-related symptoms. In a sample of individuals recently exposed to trauma (<I>N</I> = 116, 76 female), we found that PTSD symptoms at 2 weeks were associated with decreased hippocampal responses to threat as assessed with fMRI. Further, the relationship between hippocampal threat sensitivity and PTSD symptomology only emerged in individuals who showed transient, high threat-related arousal, as assayed by an independently collected measure of fear potentiated startle. Collectively, our finding suggests that development of PTSD is associated with threat-related decreases in hippocampal function because of increases in fear-potentiated arousal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alterations in hippocampal function linked to threat-related arousal are reliably associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, how these alterations relate to the sequelae of trauma-related symptoms is unknown. Prior models based on nontrauma samples suggest that arousal may impact hippocampal neurophysiology leading to maladaptive behavior. Here we show that decreased hippocampal threat sensitivity interacts with fear-potentiated startle to predict PTSD symptoms. Specifically, individuals with high fear-potentiated startle and low, transient hippocampal threat sensitivity showed the greatest PTSD symptomology. These findings bridge literatures of threat-related arousal and hippocampal function to better understand PTSD risk.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase in MEC-mPFC Neurons Contributes to Remote Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The PFC is thought to be the region where remote memory is recalled. However, the neurotrophic receptors that underlie the remote memory remain largely unknown. Here, we benefited from auto-assembly split Cre to accomplish the neural projection-specific recombinase activity without spontaneous leakage. Deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in neurons projecting from the medial entorhinal cortex to the mPFC displayed reduced remote memory recall from the male mice, but the recent recall was intact. We found that the TrkB deletion attenuates the participation of mPFC cells in the remote fear memory recall. The disruption of remote recall was attributed to reduced reactivation of cells in the mPFC. Notably, TrkB deletion seriously inhibited experience-dependent maturation of oligodendroglia in the PFC, resulting in defects in remote recall that were rescued by clemastine administration. Together, our data suggest that TrkB in intercortical circuits functions in remote memory consolidation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Retrieving the past experiences or events is essential for the ones to lead life. The investigations performed in the rodent model have disclosed that the systems consolidation of memory accompanying changes of cortical circuits and transcriptome is required for maintaining the memory for a long time. In this study, the split Cre with TrkB<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice were subjected to discover that TrkB in the neurons plays a role in remote memory consolidation. We evaluated the contextual fear memory and labeled cells, which revealed deletion of TrkB interrupts newborn oligodendrocyte and reactivation of cells in mPFC at remote recall. Our data provide the implication that remote memory is relevant to neurotrophic receptor signaling as well as its influence on non-neuronal cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dopamine Modulates Adaptive Forgetting in Medial Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Active forgetting occurs in many species, but how behavioral control mechanisms influence which memories are forgotten remains unknown. We previously found that when rats need to retrieve a memory to guide exploration, it reduces later retention of other competing memories encoded in that environment. As with humans, this retrieval-induced forgetting relies on prefrontal control processes. Dopaminergic input to the prefrontal cortex is important for executive functions and cognitive flexibility. We found that, in a similar way, retrieval-induced forgetting of competing memories in male rats requires prefrontal dopamine signaling through D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors. Blockade of medial prefrontal cortex D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors as animals encountered a familiar object impaired active forgetting of competing object memories as measured on a later long-term memory test. Inactivation of the ventral tegmental area produced the same pattern of behavior, a pattern that could be reversed by concomitant activation of prefrontal D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors. We observed a bidirectional modulation of retrieval-induced forgetting by agonists and antagonists of D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings establish the essential role of prefrontal dopamine in the active forgetting of competing memories, contributing to the shaping of retention in response to the behavioral goals of an organism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Forgetting is a ubiquitous phenomenon that is actively promoted in many species. The very act of remembering some experiences can cause forgetting of others, in both humans and rats. This retrieval-induced forgetting process is thought to be driven by inhibitory control signals from the prefrontal cortex that target areas where the memories are stored. Here we started disentangling the neurochemical signals in the prefrontal cortex that are essential to retrieval-induced forgetting. We found that, in rats, the release of dopamine in this area, acting through D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors, was essential to causing active forgetting of competing memories. Inhibition of D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors impaired forgetting, while activation increased forgetting. These findings are important, because the mechanisms of active forgetting and their linkage to goal-directed behavior are only beginning to be understood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deletion of the P/Q-Type Calcium Channel from Serotonergic Neurons Drives Male Aggression in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aggressive behavior is one of the most conserved social interactions in nature and serves as a crucial evolutionary trait. Serotonin (5-HT) plays a key role in the regulation of our emotions, such as anxiety and aggression, but which molecules and mechanisms in the serotonergic system are involved in violent behavior are still unknown. In this study, we show that deletion of the P/Q-type calcium channel selectively from serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) augments aggressive behavior in male mice, while anxiety is not affected. These mice demonstrated increased induction of the immediate early gene <I>c-fos</I> and <I>in vivo</I> serotonergic firing activity in the DRN. The ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus is also a prominent region of the brain mediating aggression. We confirmed a monosynaptic projection from the DRN to the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus, and silencing these projections with an inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug effectively reduced aggressive behavior. Overall, our findings show that deletion of the P/Q-type calcium channel from DRN neurons is sufficient to induce male aggression in mice and regulating its activity may serve as a therapeutic approach to treat violent behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we show that P/Q-type calcium channel is mediating aggression in serotonergic neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus via monosynaptic projections to the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus. More importantly, silencing these projections reduced aggressive behavior in mice and may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating aggression in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Enhanced Feedback Inhibition Due to Increased Recruitment of Somatostatin-Expressing Interneurons and Enhanced Cortical Recurrent Excitation in a Genetic Mouse Model of Migraine</a></h4>

              
                <p>Migraine is a complex brain disorder, characterized by attacks of unilateral headache and global dysfunction in multisensory information processing, whose underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms remain unknown. The finding of enhanced excitatory, but unaltered inhibitory, neurotransmission at cortical synapses between pyramidal cells (PCs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FS INs) in mouse models of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) suggested the hypothesis that dysregulation of the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance in specific circuits is a key pathogenic mechanism. Here, we investigated the cortical layer 2/3 (L2/3) feedback inhibition microcircuit involving somatostatin-expressing (SOM) INs in FHM1 mice of both sexes carrying a gain-of-function mutation in Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.1. Unitary inhibitory neurotransmission at SOM IN-PC synapses was unaltered while excitatory neurotransmission at both PC-SOM IN and PC-PC synapses was enhanced, because of increased probability of glutamate release, in FHM1 mice. Short-term synaptic depression was enhanced at PC-PC synapses while short-term synaptic facilitation was unaltered at PC-SOM IN synapses during 25-Hz repetitive activity. The frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition (FDDI) mediated by SOM INs was enhanced, lasted longer and required shorter high-frequency bursts to be initiated in FHM1 mice. These findings, together with previous evidence of enhanced disynaptic feedforward inhibition by FS INs, suggest that the increased inhibition may effectively counteract the increased recurrent excitation in FHM1 mice and may even prevail in certain conditions. Considering the involvement of SOM INs in  oscillations, surround suppression and context-dependent sensory perception, the facilitated recruitment of SOM INs, together with the enhanced recurrent excitation, may contribute to dysfunctional sensory processing in FHM1 and possibly migraine.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Migraine is a complex brain disorder, characterized by attacks of unilateral headache and global dysfunction in multisensory information processing, whose underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms remain unknown, although dysregulation of the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance in specific circuits could be a key pathogenic mechanism. Here, we provide insights into these mechanisms by investigating the cortical feedback inhibition microcircuit involving somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM INs) in a mouse model of a rare monogenic migraine. Despite unaltered inhibitory synaptic transmission, the disynaptic feedback inhibition mediated by SOM INs was enhanced in the migraine model because of enhanced recruitment of the INs. Recurrent cortical excitation was also enhanced. These alterations may contribute to context-dependent sensory processing dysfunctions in migraine.</p>

                Background: The study aimed to examine the effect of administering CHAGURO (a product of the combination of siamese pumpkin and tuna-based powder) on the lipid profile in prediabetes individuals with dyslipidemia. Methods: The experimental trial was conducted with two intervention groups, with each group receiving a dose of 7.5g/70kg body weight (BW)/day (low dose) and 15g/70kg BW/day (high dose) for 60 days. Respondents in each group ranged in age from 30 to 60 years old. Prediabetes was defined as fasting blood sugar levels of 100-125 mg/dL, while cholesterol levels of 200 mg/dL was considered dyslipidemia. The mean baseline HbA1c level for all subjects was 5.5%. Respondents were randomized into intervention groups using simple randomization. Pre-test and post-test measurements were performed for body mass index (BMI), physical activity (using IPAQ-SF), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid profile, blood pressure, and food intake (using SQ-FFQ). Statistical analyses performed included descriptive tests, independent and paired T-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Compared to the baseline, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides in the two groups did not improve significantly by 60 days. For lipid variables, a significant improvement in the cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (chol/HDL) ratios were observed when compared against the baseline for the two groups. When comparing the changes between groups, 7.5 g of CHAGURO showed a larger improvement in HDL-C (mean differences: 1.86 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.86-4.59), compared to 15 g of CHAGURO (mean differences: -3.62 mg/dL; 95% CI: -7.53-0.28). A significant (p<0.05) decrease in the chol/HDL ratio was observed in the 7.5 g CHAGURO group (mean differences: -0.20 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.39-(-0.01)). Conclusions: CHAGURO can be a functional food alternative to improve the condition of prediabetes people with dyslipidemia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computer simulations of Template-Directed RNA Synthesis driven by temperature cycling in diverse sequence mixtures</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pouyan Chamanian, Paul G. Higgs</p>

We present simulations of non-enzymatic template-directed RNA synthesis that incorporate primer extension, ligation, melting, and reannealing. Strand growth occurs over multiple heating/cooling cycles, producing strands of several hundred nucleotides in length, starting with random oligomers of 4 to 10 nucleotides. A strand typically grows by only 1 or 2 nucleotides in each cycle. Therefore, a strand is copied from many different templates, not from one specific complementary strand. A diverse sequence mixture is produced, and there is no exact copying of sequences, even if single base additions are fully accurate (no mutational errors). It has been proposed that RNA systems may contain a virtual circular genome, in which sequences partially overlap in a way that is mutually catalytic. We show that virtual circles do not emerge naturally in our simulations, and that a system initiated with a virtual circle can only maintain itself if there are no mutational errors and there is no input of new sequences formed by random polymerization. Furthermore, if a virtual sequence and its complement contain repeated short words, new sequences can be produced that were not on the original virtual circle. Therefore the virtual circle sequence cannot maintain itself. Functional sequences with secondary structures contain complementary words on opposite sides of stem regions. Both these words are repeated in the complementary sequence; hence, functional sequences cannot be encoded on a virtual circle. Additionally, we consider sequence replication in populations of protocells. We suppose that functional ribozymes benefit the cell which contains them. Nevertheless, scrambling of sequences occurs, and the functional sequence is not maintained, even when under positive selection.

                <p>by Vladimir Shchur, Vadim Spirin, Dmitry Sirotkin, Evgeni Burovski, Nicola De Maio, Russell Corbett-Detig</p>

Accurate simulation of complex biological processes is an essential component of developing and validating new technologies and inference approaches. As an effort to help contain the COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced from most regions in the world. More than 5.5 million viral sequences are publicly available as of November 2021. Many studies estimate viral genealogies from these sequences, as these can provide valuable information about the spread of the pandemic across time and space. Additionally such data are a rich source of information about molecular evolutionary processes including natural selection, for example allowing the identification of new variants with transmissibility and immunity evasion advantages. To our knowledge, there is no framework that is both efficient and flexible enough to simulate the pandemic to approximate world-scale scenarios and generate viral genealogies of millions of samples. Here, we introduce a new fast simulator VGsim which addresses the problem of simulation genealogies under epidemiological models. The simulation process is split into two phases. During the forward run the algorithm generates a chain of population-level events reflecting the dynamics of the pandemic using an hierarchical version of the Gillespie algorithm. During the backward run a coalescent-like approach generates a tree genealogy of samples conditioning on the population-level events chain generated during the forward run. Our software can model complex population structure, epistasis and immunity escape.

    Chromatin marks are recognized by distinct binding modules, many of which are embedded in multidomain proteins. How the different functionalities of such complex chromatin modulators are regulated is often unclear. Here, we delineated the interplay of the H3 amino terminus– and K9me-binding activities of the multidomain hUHRF1 protein. We show that the phosphoinositide PI5P interacts simultaneously with two distant flexible linker regions connecting distinct domains of hUHRF1. The binding is dependent on both, the polar head group, and the acyl part of the phospholipid and induces a conformational rearrangement juxtaposing the H3 amino terminus and K9me3 recognition modules of the protein. In consequence, the two features of the H3 tail are bound in a multivalent, synergistic manner. Our work highlights a previously unidentified molecular function for PI5P outside of the context of lipid mono- or bilayers and establishes a molecular paradigm for the allosteric regulation of complex, multidomain chromatin modulators by small cellular molecules.

    The excitation-contraction dynamics in cardiac tissue are the most important physiological parameters for assessing developmental state. We demonstrate integrated nanoelectronic sensors capable of simultaneously probing electrical and mechanical cellular responses. The sensor is configured from a three-dimensional nanotransistor with its conduction channel protruding out of the plane. The structure promotes not only a tight seal with the cell for detecting action potential via field effect but also a close mechanical coupling for detecting cellular force via piezoresistive effect. Arrays of nanotransistors are integrated to realize label-free, submillisecond, and scalable interrogation of correlated cell dynamics, showing advantages in tracking and differentiating cell states in drug studies. The sensor can further decode vector information in cellular motion beyond typical scalar information acquired at the tissue level, hence offering an improved tool for cell mechanics studies. The sensor enables not only improved bioelectronic detections but also reduced invasiveness through the two-in-one converging integration.

    Coarse-grained, mesoscale simulations are invaluable for studying soft condensed matter because of their ability to model systems in which a background solvent plays a substantial role but is not the primary interest. Such methods generally model passive solvents; however, far-from-equilibrium systems may also be composed of complex solutes suspended in an active fluid. Yet, few coarse-grained simulation methods exist to model an active medium. We introduce an algorithm to simulate active nematics, which builds on multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD) for passive fluctuating nematohydrodynamics by introducing dipolar activity in the local collision operator. Active nematic MPCD (AN-MPCD) simulations not only exhibit the key characteristics of active nematic turbulence but, as a particle-based algorithm, also reproduce crucial attributes of active particle models. Thus, mesoscopic AN-MPCD is an approach that bridges microscopic and continuum descriptions, allowing simulations of composite active-passive systems.

    The poor contractility of the detrusor muscle in underactive bladders (UABs) fails to increase the pressure inside the UAB, leading to strenuous and incomplete urination. However, existing therapeutic strategies by modulating/repairing detrusor muscles, e.g., neurostimulation and regenerative medicine, still have low efficacy and/or adverse effects. Here, we present an implantable magnetic soft robotic bladder (MRB) that can directly apply mechanical compression to the UAB to assist urination. Composed of a biocompatible elastomer composite with optimized magnetic domains, the MRB enables on-demand contraction of the UAB when actuated by magnetic fields. A representative MRB for a UAB in a porcine model is demonstrated, and MRB-assisted urination is validated by in situ computed tomography imaging after 14-day implantation. The urodynamic tests show a series of successful urination with a high pressure increase and fast urine flow. Our work paves the way for developing MRB to assist urination for humans with UABs.

    Improved agricultural and industrial production organisms are required to meet the future global food demands and minimize the effects of climate change. A new resource for crop and microbe improvement, designated FIND-IT (Fast Identification of Nucleotide variants by droplet DigITal PCR), provides ultrafast identification and isolation of predetermined, targeted genetic variants in a screening cycle of less than 10 days. Using large-scale sample pooling in combination with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) greatly increases the size of low–mutation density and screenable variant libraries and the probability of identifying the variant of interest. The method is validated by screening variant libraries totaling 500,000 barley (
    <i>
     Hordeum vulgare
    </i>
    ) individuals and isolating more than 125 targeted barley gene knockout lines and miRNA or promoter variants enabling functional gene analysis. FIND-IT variants are directly applicable to elite breeding pipelines and minimize time-consuming technical steps to accelerate the evolution of germplasm.

Single-nuclei sequencing shows that regenerated and uninjured legs are indistinguishable in terms of cell-type composition and transcriptional profiles. This remarkable fidelity highlights the ability of organisms to achieve identical outcomes via distinct processes.

    We report carbon-hydrogen acetoxylation of nondirected arenes benzene and toluene, as well as related functionalization with pivalate and 2-ethylhexanoate ester groups, using simple copper(II) [Cu(II)] salts with over 80% yield. By changing the ratio of benzene and Cu(II) salts, 2.4% conversion of benzene can be reached. Combined experimental and computational studies results indicate that the arene carbon-hydrogen functionalization likely occurs by a nonradical Cu(II)-mediated organometallic pathway. The Cu(II) salts used in the reaction can be isolated, recycled, and reused with little change in reactivity. In addition, the Cu(II) salts can be regenerated in situ using oxygen and, after the removal of the generated water, the arene carbon-hydrogen acetoxylation and related esterification reactions can be continued, which leads to a process that enables recycling of Cu(II).

    Meiosis entry during spermatogenesis requires reprogramming from mitotic to meiotic gene expression profiles. Transcriptional regulation has been extensively studied in meiosis entry, but gain of function for master transcription factors is insufficient to down-regulate mitotic genes. RNA helicase YTHDC2 and its partner MEIOC emerge as essential posttranscriptional regulators of meiotic entry. However, it is unclear what governs the RNA binding specificity of YTHDC2/MEIOC. Here, we identified RNA binding protein RBM46 as a component of the YTHDC2/MEIOC complex. Testis-specific

Dysregulated RBM46 expression is associated with human male fertility disorders. These findings establish the RBM46/YTHDC2/MEIOC complex as the major posttranscriptional regulator responsible for down-regulating mitotic transcripts during meiosis entry in mammalian spermatogenesis, with implications for understanding meiosis-related fertility disorders.

    Vegetable oils are not only major components of human diet but also vital for industrial applications. WRINKLED1 (WRI1) is a pivotal transcription factor governing plant oil biosynthesis, but the underlying DNA-binding mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, we resolved the structure of Arabidopsis WRI1 (AtWRI1) with its cognate double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), revealing two antiparallel β sheets in the tandem AP2 domains that intercalate into the adjacent major grooves of dsDNA to determine the sequence recognition specificity. We showed that AtWRI1 represented a previously unidentified structural fold and DNA-binding mode. Mutations of the key residues interacting with DNA element affected its binding affinity and oil biosynthesis when these variants were transiently expressed in tobacco leaves. Seed oil content was enhanced in stable transgenic

    expressing an AtWRI1 variant (W74R). Together, our findings offer a structural basis explaining WRI1 recognition and binding of DNA and suggest an alternative strategy to increase oil yield in crops through WRI1 bioengineering.

    Radiotherapy increases tumor cure and survival rates; however, radiotherapy-induced bone damage remains a common issue for which effective countermeasures are lacking, especially considering tumor recurrence risks. We report a high-specificity protection technique based on noninvasive electromagnetic field (EMF). A unique pulsed-burst EMF (PEMF) at 15 Hz and 2 mT induces notable Ca

    spikes in osteoblasts in contrast to other waveforms. This waveform parameter substantially inhibits radiotherapy-induced bone loss by specifically modulating osteoblasts without affecting other bone cell types or tumor cells. Mechanistically, primary cilia are identified as major PEMF sensors in osteoblasts, and the differentiated ciliary expression dominates distinct PEMF sensitivity between osteoblasts and tumor cells. PEMF-induced unique Ca

Our study introduces a previously unidentified method against radiation-induced bone damage in a noninvasive, cost-effective, and highly specific manner.

    Immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) plays critical roles in controlling infections and inflammatory tissue injuries. Here, we show that
    <i>
     AFF3
    </i>
    , a candidate gene for both rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes, is a molecular facilitator of CSR with an isotype preference.
    <i>
     Aff3
    </i>
    -deficient mice exhibit low serum levels of immunoglobulins, predominantly immunoglobulin G2c (IgG2c) followed by IgG1 and IgG3 but not IgM. Furthermore,
    <i>
     Aff3
    </i>
    -deficient mice show weak resistance to
    <i>
     Plasmodium yoelii
    </i>
    infection, confirming that
    <i>
     Aff3
    </i>
    modulates immunity to this pathogen. Mechanistically, the AFF3 protein binds to the IgM and IgG1 switch regions via a C-terminal domain, and
    <i>
     Aff3
    </i>
    deficiency reduces the binding of AID to the switch regions less efficiently. One
    <i>
     AFF3
    </i>
    risk allele for rheumatoid arthritis is associated with high mRNA expression of
    <i>
     AFF3

    <i>
     IGHG2
    </i>
    , and
    <i>

    in human B cells. These findings demonstrate that AFF3 directly regulates CSR by facilitating the recruitment of AID to the switch regions.

    Abstract

   <div>
    Site-2 proteases are a conserved family of intramembrane proteases that cleave transmembrane substrates to regulate signal transduction and maintain proteostasis. Here, we elucidated crystal structures of inhibitor-bound forms of bacterial site-2 proteases including
    <i>
     Escherichia coli
    </i>
    RseP. Structure-based chemical modification and cross-linking experiments indicated that the RseP domains surrounding the active center undergo conformational changes to expose the substrate-binding site, suggesting that RseP has a gating mechanism to regulate substrate entry. Furthermore, mutational analysis suggests that a conserved electrostatic linkage between the transmembrane and peripheral membrane-associated domains mediates the conformational changes. In vivo cleavage assays also support that the substrate transmembrane helix is unwound by strand addition to the intramembrane β sheet of RseP and is clamped by a conserved asparagine residue at the active center for efficient cleavage. This mechanism underlying the substrate binding, i.e., unwinding and clamping, appears common across distinct families of intramembrane proteases that cleave transmembrane segments.

    Online misinformation continues to have adverse consequences for society. Inoculation theory has been put forward as a way to reduce susceptibility to misinformation by informing people about how they might be misinformed, but its scalability has been elusive both at a theoretical level and a practical level. We developed five short videos that inoculate people against manipulation techniques commonly used in misinformation: emotionally manipulative language, incoherence, false dichotomies, scapegoating, and ad hominem attacks. In seven preregistered studies, i.e., six randomized controlled studies (
    <i>
     n
    </i>
    = 6464) and an ecologically valid field study on YouTube (
    <i>
     n
    </i>
    = 22,632), we find that these videos improve manipulation technique recognition, boost confidence in spotting these techniques, increase people’s ability to discern trustworthy from untrustworthy content, and improve the quality of their sharing decisions. These effects are robust across the political spectrum and a wide variety of covariates. We show that psychological inoculation campaigns on social media are effective at improving misinformation resilience at scale.

    Invasive species are a key driver of the global biodiversity crisis, but the drivers of invasiveness, including the role of pathogens, remain debated. We investigated the genomic basis of invasiveness in
    <i>
     Ambrosia artemisiifolia
    </i>
    (common ragweed), introduced to Europe in the late 19th century, by resequencing 655 ragweed genomes, including 308 herbarium specimens collected up to 190 years ago. In invasive European populations, we found selection signatures in defense genes and lower prevalence of disease-inducing plant pathogens. Together with temporal changes in population structure associated with introgression from closely related
    <i>
     Ambrosia
    </i>
    species, escape from specific microbial enemies likely favored the plant’s remarkable success as an invasive species.

    Wearable assistive, rehabilitative, and augmentative devices currently require bulky power supplies, often making these tools more of a burden than an asset. This work introduces a soft, low-profile, textile-based pneumatic energy harvesting system that extracts power directly from the foot strike of a user during walking. Energy is harvested with a textile pump integrated into the insole of the user’s shoe and stored in a wearable textile bladder to operate pneumatic actuators on demand, with system performance optimized based on a mechano-fluidic model. The system recovered a maximum average power of nearly 3 W with over 20% conversion efficiency—outperforming electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and triboelectric alternatives—and was used to power a wearable arm-lift device that assists shoulder motion and a supernumerary robotic arm, demonstrating its capability as a lightweight, low-cost, and comfortable solution to support adults with upper body functional limitations in activities of daily living.

    Human skin is a remarkable example of a biological material that displays unique mechanical characters of both soft elasticity and stretchability. However, mimicking these features has been absent in photoresponsive soft matters. Here, we present one synthetic ABA-type triblock copolymer consisting of polystyrene as end blocks and one photoresponsive azopolymer as the middle block, which is stiffness at room temperature and shows a phototunable transition to soft elastics athermally. We have synthesized an elastics we term “photoinduced soft elastomer,” where the photo-evocable soft midblock of azopolymer and the glassy polystyrene domains act as elastic matrix and physical cross-linking junctions, respectively. On the basis of the photoswitchable transformation between stiffness and elasticity at room temperature, we demonstrated precise control over nanopatterns on nonplanar substrates especially adaptable in the human skin and fabrication of packaged perovskite solar cells, enabling the simple, human-friendly, and controllable approach to be promising for mechanically adaptable soft photonic and electronic packaging applications.

    Immunomodulation is an essential consideration for cell replacement procedures. Unfortunately, lifelong exposure to nonspecific systemic immunosuppression results in immunodeficiency and has toxic effects on nonimmune cells. Here, we engineered hybrid spheroids of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with rapamycin-releasing poly(lactic-
    <i>

    </i>
    -glycolic acid) microparticles (RAP-MPs) to prevent immune rejection of islet xenografts in diabetic C57BL/6 mice. Hybrid spheroids were rapidly formed by incubating cell-particle mixture in methylcellulose solution while maintaining high cell viability. RAP-MPs were uniformly distributed in hybrid spheroids and sustainably released RAP for ~3 weeks. Locoregional transplantation of hybrid spheroids containing low doses of RAP-MPs (200- to 4000-ng RAP per recipient) significantly prolonged islet survival times and promoted the generation of regional regulatory T cells. Enhanced programmed death-ligand 1 expression by MSCs was found to be responsible for the immunomodulatory performance of hybrid spheroids. Our results suggest that these hybrid spheroids offer a promising platform for the efficient use of MSCs in the transplantation field.

    Topological defects on colloids rotating in nematic liquid crystals form far-from-equilibrium structures that perform complex swim strokes in which the defects periodically extend, depin, and contract. These defect dynamics propel the colloid, generating translation from rotation. The swimmer’s speed and direction are determined by the topological defect’s polarity and extent of elongation. Defect elongation is controlled by a rotating external magnetic field, allowing control over particle trajectories. The swimmers’ translational motion relies on broken symmetries associated with lubrication forces between the colloid and the bounding surfaces, line tensions associated with the elongated defect, and anisotropic viscosities associated with the defect elongation adjacent to the colloid. The scattering or effective pair interaction of these swimmers is highly anisotropic, with polarization-dependent dimer stability and motion that depend strongly on entanglement and sharing of their extended defect structures. This research introduces transient, far-from-equilibrium topological defects as a class of virtual functional structures that generate modalities of motion and interaction.

    T cells show tremendous efficacy as cellular therapeutics. However, obtaining primary T cells from human donors is expensive and variable. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have the potential to provide a renewable source of T cells, but differentiating PSCs into hematopoietic progenitors with T cell potential remains an important challenge. Here, we report an efficient serum- and feeder-free system for differentiating human PSCs into hematopoietic progenitors and T cells. This fully defined approach allowed us to study the impact of individual proteins on blood emergence and differentiation. Providing DLL4 and VCAM1 during the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition enhanced downstream progenitor T cell output by ~80-fold. These two proteins synergized to activate notch signaling in nascent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and VCAM1 additionally promoted an inflammatory transcriptional program. We also established optimized medium formulations that enabled efficient and chemically defined maturation of functional CD8αβ

   <div>
    The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) continues to pose a substantial global health threat. Along with vaccines and targeted therapeutics, there is a critical need for rapid diagnostic solutions. In this work, we use computational protein modeling tools to suggest molecular beacon architectures that function as conformational switches for high-sensitivity detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD). Integrating these beacons on a miniaturized total internal reflection fluorescence (mini-TIRF) microscope, we detect the S-RBD and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 with limits of detection in the femtomolar range. We envision that our designed mini-TIRF platform will serve as a robust platform for point-of-care diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 and future emergent viral threats.

    Most gene-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines are nonreplicating vectors. They deliver the gene or messenger RNA to the cell to express the spike protein but do not replicate to amplify antigen production. This study tested the utility of replication in a vaccine by comparing replication-defective adenovirus (RD-Ad) and replicating single-cycle adenovirus (SC-Ad) vaccines that express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. SC-Ad produced 100 times more spike protein than RD-Ad and generated significantly higher antibodies against the spike protein than RD-Ad after single immunization of Ad-permissive hamsters. SC-Ad–generated antibodies climbed over 14 weeks after single immunization and persisted for more than 10 months. When the hamsters were challenged 10.5 months after single immunization, a single intranasal or intramuscular immunization with SC-Ad-Spike reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and damage in the lungs and preserved body weight better than vaccination with RD-Ad-Spike. This demonstrates the utility of harnessing replication in vaccines to amplify protection against infectious diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A general hypothesis of multistable systems in pathophysiology [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Despite intensive investigations numerous diseases remain etiologically puzzling and recalcitrant to treatments. A hypothesis is proposed here assuming that these difficulties are due to an unsuitable approach to the mechanisms of life, which is subjugated by an apparent complexity and fails to grasp the uniformity that lays behind. The stability of metabolism, despite the enormous complex of chemical reactions, suggests that reciprocal control is a prerequisite of life. Negative feedback loops have been known for a long time to maintain homeostasis, while more recently, different life processes involved in transitions or changes have been modeled by positive loops giving rise to bistable switches, also including various diseases. The present hypothesis makes a generalization, by assuming that any functional element of a biological system is involved in a positive or a negative feedback loop. Consequently, the hypothesis holds that the starting mechanism of any disease that affects a healthy human can be conceptually reduced to a bistable or multistationary loop system, thus providing a unifying model leading to the discovery of critical therapeutic targets.

                Temporary blindness, also known as transient cortical blindness, is an uncommon impediment of contrast agent usage during angiography procedures. The occurrence of blindness after a cardiac catheterization procedure is rare and its pathophysiology remains largely speculative. The most probable mechanism seems to be contrast agent-related disruption of the blood–brain barrier, possibly initiated by several predisposing factors. This case reports a 52-year-old man with transient vision loss that occurred following coronary angiography. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no acute pathology and his vision spontaneously returned within approximately 15 hours post-procedure without any requirement of specific therapy. Suggesting that transient cortical blindness may have occurred following coronary angiography which subsequently self-resolved.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">What can we experience and report on a rapidly presented image? Intersubjective measures of specificity of freely reported contents of consciousness [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A majority of previous studies appear to support a view that human observers can only perceive coarse information from a natural scene image when it is presented rapidly (<100ms, masked). In these studies, participants were often forced to choose an answer from options that experimenters preselected. These options can underestimate what participants experience and can report on it. The current study aims to introduce a novel methodology to investigate how detailed information participants can report after briefly seeing a natural scene image.     Methods: We used a novel free-report paradigm to examine what people can freely report following a rapidly presented natural scene image (67/133/267ms, masked). N = 600 online participants typed up to five words to report what they saw in the image together with confidence of the respective responses. We developed a novel index, Intersubjective Agreement (IA). IA quantifies how specifically the response words were used to describe the target image, with a high value meaning the word is not often reported for other images. Importantly, IA eliminates the need for experimenters to preselect response options. Results: The words with high IA values are often something detailed (e.g., a small object) in a particular image. With IA, unlike commonly believed, we demonstrated that participants reported highly specific and detailed aspects of the briefly (even at 67ms, masked) shown image. Further, IA is positively correlated with confidence, indicating metacognitive conscious access to the reported aspects of the image. Conclusion: These new findings challenge the dominant view that the content of rapid scene experience is limited to global and coarse gist. Our novel paradigm opens a door to investigate various contents of consciousness with a free-report paradigm.

                TBK1 is a serine-threonine protein kinase that has been linked to a number of diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Reproducible research on TBK1 has been hampered by the lack of well characterized antibodies. In this study, we characterized 11 commercial antibodies for TBK1 for use in immunoblot, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using an isogeneic knock-out cell line as a control. We identify antibodies that appear specific for all three applications but invite the readers to interpret the present findings based on their own scientific expertise and use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">In vivo nanoscopic landscape of neurexin ligands underlying anterograde synapse specification</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic organizers, such as neuroligin1, LRRTM1, and Cbln1, commonly target neurexin. Using X10 expansion microscopy, Nozawa et al. revealed that presynaptic neurexin isoforms regulated nanoclusters of postsynaptic neurexin ligands and glutamate receptor subtypes. Their findings provide models of how neurexin ligands coordinate or compete to organize excitatory synapses in vivo.
