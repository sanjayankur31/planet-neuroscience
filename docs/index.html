              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Plea for a Simple But Radical Change in Scientific Publication: To Improve Openness, Reliability, and Reproducibility, Lets Deposit and Validate Our Results before Writing Articles</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Limited reproducibility and validity are major sources of concern in biology and other fields of science. Their origins have been extensively described and include material variability, incomplete materials and methods report, results selection, defective experimental design, lack of power, inappropriate statistics, overinterpretation, and reluctance to publish negative results. Promoting complete and accurate communication of positive and negative results is a major objective. Multiple steps in this direction are taken, but they are not sufficient and the general construction of articles has not been questioned. I propose here a simple change with a potentially strong positive impact. First, when they complete a substantial coherent set of experiments, scientists deposit their positive or negative results in a database ["deposited results," (DRs)], including detailed materials, methods, raw data, analysis, and processed results. The DRs are technically reviewed and validated as "validated DRs" (vDRs) or rejected until satisfactory. vDR databases are open (after an embargo period if requested by the authors) and can later be updated by them or others with replications or replication failures, providing a comprehensive active log of scientific data. Articles, in this proposal, are then built as they currently are, except they only include vDRs as strong and open building blocks. I argue that this approach would increase the transparency, reproducibility, and reliability of scientific publications and have additional advantages including accurate author credit, better material for evaluation, exhaustive scientific archiving, and increased openness of life science material.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Shaping Information Processing: The Role of Oscillatory Dynamics in a Working Memory Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neural oscillations are thought to reflect low-level operations that can be used for higher-level cognitive functions. Here, we investigated the role of brain rhythms in the 1&ndash;30 Hz range by recording MEG in human participants performing a visual delayed match-to-sample paradigm in which orientation or spatial frequency of sample and probe gratings had to be matched. A cue occurring before or after sample presentation indicated the to-be-matched feature. We demonstrate that alpha/beta power decrease tracks the presentation of the informative cue and indexes faster responses. Moreover, these faster responses coincided with an augmented phase alignment of slow oscillations, as well as phase&ndash;amplitude coupling between slow and fast oscillations. Importantly, stimulus decodability was boosted by both low alpha power and high beta power. In summary, we provide support for a comprehensive framework in which different rhythms play specific roles: slow rhythms control input sampling, while alpha (and beta) gates the information flow, beta recruits task-relevant circuits, and the timing of faster oscillations is controlled by slower ones.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An expert opinion on antacids: A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Acidity caused by common gastric conditions such as non-ulcer dyspepsia, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, stress gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatic insufficiency, bile acid-mediated diarrhea, biliary reflux, and constipation can be treated by administration of potent and efficacious acid suppressant (anti-secretory) agents such as antacids, histamine H2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Antacids provide symptomatic relief from hyperacidity as well as other associated conditions by neutralizing the gastric acid directly, thereby raising the gastric pH, attenuating the pepsin activity, restoring acid-base balance, and increasing prostaglandin and bicarbonate secretion. The effectiveness of antacids is determined by its acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and buffering capacity. Antacids containing a combination of aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and other ingredients such as those present in Digene showed better therapeutic efficacy even at low dosage with fewer side effects, persistent increase in gastric pH, faster and longer duration of pain relief, and fast relief from gas. Various clinical studies suggest that to obtain fast symptomatic relief, the treating physician can utilize antacids with the highest neutralizing capacities like Digene.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Construction and validation of a scale of sexual self-concept for the elderly Chilean population [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sexual self-concept has a central role in the life of the elderly population. Indeed, their sexual self-concept has significant and positive relationships with their satisfaction with life, pleasure, and willingness to interact with others. However, social-cultural prejudice means that the elderly are considered asexual individuals, harming their sexual self-concept. This prejudice is prominent in Chile, where the elderly do not have access to clear information about their sexuality. However, research on the Chilean elderly population is still in its infancy and requires more attention. Hence, this research aims to construct and validate a scale of sexual self-concept for the elderly Chilean population to cover this identified gap in the literature. Methods: Sixty items were integrated into the first version of the scale. Ten external judges were asked to assess the content validity. Twenty-eight items were maintained. Subsequently, an instrumental and cross-sectional design was implemented with a non-probabilistic sampling (N = 188). Items were refined with corrected homogeneity indices and conditional estimates of Cronbach's alpha and Omega coefficient. Results: A final scale of nine items equally distributed in three dimensions was obtained: Sexual self-efficacy (ω = 0.867), Sexual assertiveness (ω = 0.764), and Sexual self-esteem (ω = 0.803). The confirmatory factor analysis reflects that the theoretical model has an adequate fit (CFI = .989; TLI = .984; RMSEA = .086). Conclusions: The data analyses confirmed that the scale has adequate psychometric properties. This scale can be used for multidimensional measurements of sexual self-concept in the elderly in Chile. Further research can confirm its psychometric properties in different settings within the Spanish language population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison between the effects of two treatment regimens from GINA guidelines step 3 on quality of life and inflammatory biomarkers of pediatric asthmatic patients: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Asthma is a complicated condition characterized by chronic airway inflammation and airflow restriction, resulting in various respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. The research intended to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes of two interchangeable treatment regimens administered to a group of Iraqi asthmatic children. Methods: This observational clinical study was conducted on a sample of pediatric Iraqi asthmatic patients in the central pediatric hospital in Baghdad. The study enrolled asthmatic children with moderate persistent asthma, who a specialized physician had diagnosed. Patients had been allocated to two groups to receive either medium doses of beclomethasone inhaler (80 μg twice a day) for group one, or low doses (40 μg twice a day) plus montelukast chewable tablets (5 mg once daily) for group two. This study used the Child Health Survey–child version (CHS–child version) to investigate the quality of life of included patients. Also, this study investigated the inflammatory blood markers; (eosinophils and prostaglandin D2).   Results: This research included 63 patients ranging in age from 7 to 11 years, with a slight male preponderance: group one patients (n=30) and group two patients (n=33). Compared with baseline levels, the study groups had considerably higher quality of life scores at the first follow-up visit (P<0.05). After that, the two groups' scores were non-significantly higher at the second follow-up visit compared with the first follow-up visit (P>0.05). Both groups significantly improved inflammatory biomarkers at the first follow-up visit (P <0.05). The second follow-up visit revealed further improvement in both groups. Conclusion: This research found that both groups generated substantial improvements in study parameters compared with baseline values and that the second group, which included a beclomethasone inhaler with montelukast, was associated with the highest degree of improvement in terms of quality-of-life ratings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The impact of spinal fusion of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in Salah (Islamic Prayer) movement: a case-control study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Corrective spine surgery is widely accepted for treating severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Postoperative spinal range of motion (ROM) could be affected after such surgery. In certain populations, such as Muslims, this ROM change can impact daily life, as it may affect the five-times-a-day prayer (Salah). This study aims to assess the influence of spinal fusion (SF) in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) during the daily Islamic prayer (Salah). Methods: SF-AIS patients were videoed while performing Salah prayer. The kinematic documentation was assessed and compared to Salah movements of a control group of age-matched Muslim AIS patients, who had not had surgery. The prayer quality changes were subjectively classified into improved, no change/remained, and worsened, according to the Global Perceived Effect (GPE). Functional outcome and pain were assessed by the Scoliosis Research Society Questionnaire Version 30 (SRS-30). Results: Thirty-nine women and five men (mean age±SD: 14.8±2.3 years) met the inclusion criteria, and unoperated AIS patients were used as control (twenty-two women, mean age±SD: 15.32±1.43 years). The prostrations ROM of the SF-AIS group differed significantly from the control group (p<0.05). The GPE of the prayer movement showed improvement in 36.4%, no change in 59.1%, and worsening in 4.5% of the SF-AIS patients. The worsened group had a significantly lower bowing ROM and higher prostrations ROM compared to all groups of prayer quality changes (p<0.05). SRS-30 scores showed good outcomes (function 4.0±0.2, pain 4.2±0.5), along with the overall bowing ROM and prostrations ROM (84.2±12.0o and 53.4±9.6o, respectively). Moreover, a significant moderate positive correlation between the bowing ROM and pain (r=0.417, p=0.007) was also found. Conclusion: Spinal fusion positively affects AIS Islamic patients in maintaining their daily Salah movement, ROM and prayer quality. Prayer quality assessment should be given extra attention as an adjuvant of the SRS-30 questionnaire to evaluate Muslim patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Novel behavioral model in evaluating initiation and sustenance of teeth brushing behavior among students pursuing health sciences: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Oral hygiene maintenance is a crucial and integral feature in determining the overall wellbeing of a person. It has been established that interventions for health promotion at the public health level derived from theoretical models based on social and behavioural sciences have a superior effectiveness as compared to the ones without a theoretical background. Hence a novel behavioral model known as the multi-theory model (MTM) was used to understand two important aspects of health behavior change: (i) Initiation and (ii) Sustenance in twice daily teeth brushing in a university setting with objectives to identify factors effecting MTM in initiation and sustenance of twice daily brushing behavior among students pursuing health sciences and correlating the MTM theory with socio-demographic and behavioral patterns. Methods: The study is an analytical cross-sectional study. Students pursuing Medicine and Dentistry in a University setting were included. A validated questionnaire was designed for this study. Questions were framed to evaluate the constructs of initiation and sustenance of MTM, personality, sleeping habits and demographic corelates of participants. Multiple means between the groups were compared using analysis of variance and a post hoc test. Correlation was established between different domains, the items were then entered for hierarchical multiple regression. Results: Of the 235 participants in the study, 229 completed the questionnaire. There was a significant association between brushing quartiles, professional streams (p<0.001) and academic performance (p<0.001). The hierarchical multiple regression revealed that at stage one, behavioral confidence contributed significantly to the regression model (F (1,227) = 33.227, p<0.001) and accounted for 12.4% of the variation in twice daily brushing. Conclusion: MTM is a good tool in predicting the initiation and sustenance of twice daily brushing behavior among young adults and can form a useful tool in assessing the patterns of brushing behavior in a population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Stage 1 Registered Report: Refinement of tickling protocols to improve positive animal welfare in laboratory rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Rat tickling is a heterospecific interaction for experimenters to mimic the interactions of rat play, where they produce 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USV), symptoms of positive affect; tickling can improve laboratory rat welfare. The standard rat tickling protocol involves gently pinning the rat in a supine position. However, individual response to this protocol varies. This suggests there is a risk that some rats may perceive tickling as only a neutral experience, while others as a positive one, depending on how tickling is performed. Based on our research experiences of the standard tickling protocol we have developed a playful handling (PH) protocol, with reduced emphasis on pinning, intended to mimic more closely the dynamic nature of play. We will test whether our PH protocol gives rise to more uniform increases in positive affect across individuals relative to protocols involving pinning. We will compare the response of juvenile male and female Wistar rats as: Control (hand remains still against the side of the test arena), P0 (PH with no pinning), P1 (PH with one pin), P4 (PH with four pins). P1 and P4 consist of a background of PH, with treatments involving administration of an increasing dosage of pinning per PH session. We hypothesise that rats exposed to handling protocols that maximise playful interactions (where pinning number per session decreases) will show an overall increase in total 50 kHz USV as an indicator of positive affect, with less variability. We will explore whether behavioural and physiological changes associated with alterations in PH experience are less variable. We propose that maximising the numbers of rats experiencing tickling as a positive experience will reduce the variation in response variables affected by tickling and increase the repeatability of research where tickling is applied either as a social enrichment or as a treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Graph-based algorithms for Laplace transformed coalescence time distributions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gertjan Bisschop</p>

Extracting information on the selective and demographic past of populations that is contained in samples of genome sequences requires a description of the distribution of the underlying genealogies. Using the Laplace transform, this distribution can be generated with a simple recursive procedure, regardless of model complexity. Assuming an infinite-sites mutation model, the probability of observing specific configurations of linked variants within small haplotype blocks can be recovered from the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of branch lengths. However, the repeated differentiation required to compute these probabilities has proven to be a serious computational bottleneck in earlier implementations.
Here, I show that the state space diagram can be turned into a computational graph, allowing efficient evaluation of the Laplace transform by means of a graph traversal algorithm. This general algorithm can, for example, be applied to tabulate the likelihoods of mutational configurations in non-recombining blocks. This work provides a crucial speed up for existing composite likelihood approaches that rely on the joint distribution of branch lengths to fit isolation with migration models and estimate the parameters of selective sweeps. The associated software is available as an open-source Python library, agemo.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Radical triads, not pairs, may explain effects of hypomagnetic fields on neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jess Ramsay, Daniel R. Kattnig</p>

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognition in mice have been found to be adversely affected by hypomagnetic field exposure. The effect concurred with a reduction of reactive oxygen species in the absence of the geomagnetic field. A recent theoretical study suggests a mechanistic interpretation of this phenomenon in the framework of the Radical Pair Mechanism. According to this model, a flavin-superoxide radical pair, born in the singlet spin configuration, undergoes magnetic field-dependent spin dynamics such that the pair’s recombination is enhanced as the applied magnetic field is reduced. This model has two ostensible weaknesses: a) the assumption of a singlet initial state is irreconcilable with known reaction pathways generating such radical pairs, and b) the model neglects the swift spin relaxation of free superoxide, which abolishes any magnetic sensitivity in geomagnetic/hypomagnetic fields. We here suggest that a model based on a radical triad and the assumption of a secondary radical scavenging reaction can, in principle, explain the phenomenon without unnatural assumptions, thus providing a coherent explanation of hypomagnetic field effects in biology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The osteogenetic activities of mesenchymal stem cells in response to Mg2+ ions and inflammatory cytokines: A numerical approach using fuzzy logic controllers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jalil Nourisa, Berit Zeller-Plumhoff, Regine Willumeit-Römer</p>

Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) ions are frequently reported to regulate osteogenic activities of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In this study, we propose a numerical model to study the regulatory importance of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions on MSCs osteoblastic differentiation in the presence of an inflammatory response. A fuzzy logic controller was formulated to receive the concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and the inflammatory cytokines of TNF-α, IL-10, IL-1β, and IL-8 as cellular inputs and predict the cells’ early and late differentiation rates. Five sets of empirical data obtained from published cell culture experiments were used to calibrate the model. The model successfully reproduced the empirical data regarding the concentration- and phase-dependent effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions on the differentiation process. In agreement with the experiments, the model showed the stimulatory role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions on the early differentiation phase, once administered at low concentration, and their inhibitory role on the late differentiation phase. The numerical approach used in this study suggested 6–8 mM as the most effective concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions in promoting the early differentiation process. Also, the proposed model sheds light on the fundamental differences in the behavioral properties of cells cultured in different experiments, e.g. differentiation rate and the sensitivity of the cultured cells to stimulatory signals such as Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Thus, it can be used to interpret and compare different empirical findings. Moreover, the model successfully reproduced the nonlinearities in the concentration-dependent role of the inflammatory cytokines in early and late differentiation rates. Overall, the proposed model can be employed in studying the osteogenic properties of Mg-based implants in the presence of an inflammatory response.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal control methods for nonlinear parameter estimation in biophysical neuron models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nirag Kadakia</p>

Functional forms of biophysically-realistic neuron models are constrained by neurobiological and anatomical considerations, such as cell morphologies and the presence of known ion channels. Despite these constraints, neuron models still contain unknown static parameters which must be inferred from experiment. This inference task is most readily cast into the framework of state-space models, which systematically takes into account partial observability and measurement noise. Inferring only dynamical state variables such as membrane voltages is a well-studied problem, and has been approached with a wide range of techniques beginning with the well-known Kalman filter. Inferring both states and fixed parameters, on the other hand, is less straightforward. Here, we develop a method for joint parameter and state inference that combines traditional state space modeling with chaotic synchronization and optimal control. Our methods are tailored particularly to situations with considerable measurement noise, sparse observability, very nonlinear or chaotic dynamics, and highly uninformed priors. We illustrate our approach both in a canonical chaotic model and in a phenomenological neuron model, showing that many unknown parameters can be uncovered reliably and accurately from short and noisy observed time traces. Our method holds promise for estimation in larger-scale systems, given ongoing improvements in calcium reporters and genetically-encoded voltage indicators.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical modeling to understand the role of bivalent thrombin-fibrin binding during polymerization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael A. Kelley, Karin Leiderman</p>

Thrombin is an enzyme produced during blood coagulation that is crucial to the formation of a stable clot. Thrombin cleaves soluble fibrinogen into fibrin, which polymerizes and forms an insoluble, stabilizing gel around the growing clot. A small fraction of circulating fibrinogen is the variant <i>γ</i><sub>A</sub>/<i>γ</i>′, which has been associated with high-affinity thrombin binding and implicated as a risk factor for myocardial infarctions, deep vein thrombosis, and coronary artery disease. Thrombin is also known to be strongly sequestered by polymerized fibrin for extended periods of time in a way that is partially regulated by <i>γ</i><sub>A</sub>/<i>γ</i>′. However, the role of <i>γ</i><sub>A</sub>/<i>γ</i>′-thrombin interactions during fibrin polymerization is not fully understood. Here, we present a mathematical model of fibrin polymerization that considered the interactions between thrombin, fibrinogen, and fibrin, including those with <i>γ</i><sub>A</sub>/<i>γ</i>′. In our model, bivalent thrombin-fibrin binding greatly increased thrombin residency times and allowed for thrombin-trapping during fibrin polymerization. Results from the model showed that early in fibrin polymerization, <i>γ</i>′ binding to thrombin served to localize the thrombin to the fibrin(ogen), which effectively enhanced the enzymatic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. When all the fibrin was fully generated, however, the fibrin-thrombin binding persisted but the effect of fibrin on thrombin switched quickly to serve as a sink, essentially removing all free thrombin from the system. This dual role for <i>γ</i>′-thrombin binding during polymerization led to a paradoxical decrease in trapped thrombin as the amount of <i>γ</i>′ was increased. The model highlighted biochemical and biophysical roles for fibrin-thrombin interactions during polymerization and agreed well with experimental observations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A simple kit to use computational notebooks for more openness, reproducibility, and productivity in research</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ludmilla Figueiredo, Cédric Scherer, Juliano Sarmento Cabral</p>

The ubiquitous use of computational work for data generation, processing, and modeling increased the importance of digital documentation in improving research quality and impact. Computational notebooks are files that contain descriptive text, as well as code and its outputs, in a single, dynamic, and visually appealing file that is easier to understand by nonspecialists. Traditionally used by data scientists when producing reports and informing decision-making, the use of this tool in research publication is not common, despite its potential to increase research impact and quality. For a single study, the content of such documentation partially overlaps with that of classical lab notebooks and that of the scientific manuscript reporting the study. Therefore, to minimize the amount of work required to manage all the files related to these contents and optimize their production, we present a starter kit to facilitate the implementation of computational notebooks in the research process, including publication. The kit contains the template of a computational notebook integrated into a research project that employs R, Python, or Julia. Using examples of ecological studies, we show how computational notebooks also foster the implementation of principles of Open Science, such as reproducibility and traceability. The kit is designed for beginners, but at the end we present practices that can be gradually implemented to develop a fully digital research workflow. Our hope is that such minimalist yet effective starter kit will encourage researchers to adopt this practice in their workflow, regardless of their computational background.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Extracting individual characteristics from population data reveals a negative social effect during honeybee defence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tatjana Petrov, Matej Hajnal, Julia Klein, David Šafránek, Morgane Nouvian</p>

Honeybees protect their colony against vertebrates by mass stinging and they coordinate their actions during this crucial event thanks to an alarm pheromone carried directly on the stinger, which is therefore released upon stinging. The pheromone then recruits nearby bees so that more and more bees participate in the defence. However, a quantitative understanding of how an individual bee adapts its stinging response during the course of an attack is still a challenge: Typically, only the group behaviour is effectively measurable in experiment; Further, linking the observed group behaviour with individual responses requires a probabilistic model enumerating a combinatorial number of possible group contexts during the defence; Finally, extracting the individual characteristics from group observations requires novel methods for parameter inference.
We first experimentally observed the behaviour of groups of bees confronted with a fake predator inside an arena and quantified their defensive reaction by counting the number of stingers embedded in the dummy at the end of a trial. We propose a biologically plausible model of this phenomenon, which transparently links the choice of each individual bee to sting or not, to its group context at the time of the decision. Then, we propose an efficient method for inferring the parameters of the model from the experimental data. Finally, we use this methodology to investigate the effect of group size on stinging initiation and alarm pheromone recruitment.
Our findings shed light on how the social context influences stinging behaviour, by quantifying how the alarm pheromone concentration level affects the decision of each bee to sting or not in a given group size. We show that recruitment is curbed as group size grows, thus suggesting that the presence of nestmates is integrated as a negative cue by individual bees. Moreover, the unique integration of exact and statistical methods provides a quantitative characterisation of uncertainty associated to each of the inferred parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Demonstration of three-dimensional contact point determination and contour reconstruction during active whisking behavior of an awake rat</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lucie A. Huet, Hannah M. Emnett, Mitra J. Z. Hartmann</p>

The rodent vibrissal (whisker) system has been studied for decades as a model of active touch sensing. There are no sensors along the length of a whisker; all sensing occurs at the whisker base. Therefore, a large open question in many neuroscience studies is how an animal could estimate the three-dimensional (3D) location at which a whisker makes contact with an object. In the present work we simulated the shape of a real rat whisker to demonstrate the existence of several unique mappings from triplets of mechanical signals at the whisker base to the three-dimensional whisker-object contact point. We then used high speed video to record whisker deflections as an awake rat whisked against a peg, and used the mechanics resulting from those deflections to extract the contact points along the peg surface. These results demonstrate that measurement of specific mechanical triplets at the base of a biological whisker can enable 3D contact point determination during natural whisking behavior. The approach is viable even though the biological whisker has non-ideal, non-planar curvature, and even given the rat’s real-world choices of whisking parameters. Visual intuition for the quality of the approach is provided in a video that shows the contour of the peg gradually emerging during active whisking behavior.

                The Science family mourns longtime copyeditor Jeffrey Cook, who died unexpectedly last month. Jeff joined AAAS in 1994. He was a true perfectionist and cared deeply about language, editing, and scientific communication. Thousands of Science papers published over the past three decades are clearer and more accurate because of Jeff’s meticulous dedication to his craft. He deftly transitioned from the hardcopy era to the world of online publication. Beyond being a mainstay of the Editorial team, Jeff was an accomplished musician and multi-instrumentalist. When Science launched its weekly podcast in 2007, Jeff composed the theme music, which still welcomes listeners to this day. Jeff was kind, talented, and thorough. He will be missed.

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Ecological footprint of Russia’s Ukraine invasion | Science</a></h4>

              
                Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to have a devastating effect on the well-being of Ukrainians and their economy (1). The tragic human consequences will be compounded by the long-term ecological implications of the war, such as the contamination of soil and water by the weaponry and other pollutants, wildfires and disruptions to ecosystem structure and services, and the environmental impact of the eventual postwar rebuilding activities (2, 3). Ongoing hostilities in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station (the biggest in Europe) highlight the risks of large-scale nuclear disaster (4). To prepare for Ukraine’s recovery, we need to understand both the current and longterm environmental impacts of the war (2–5).

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Comprehensive support for diversity in STEM | Science</a></h4>

              
                In their Policy Forum “Achieving STEM diversity: Fix the classrooms” (3 June, p. 1057), J. Handelsman et al. explain that past interventions have not resulted in equitable representation for students from historically excluded communities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We agree that implementation of their suggested classroom changes would likely contribute to greater persistence and retention in STEM throughout college. However, fixing the classroom alone will not be sufficient. If we are to achieve a fully inclusive workforce (1, 2), we need a comprehensive approach that simultaneously and collaboratively addresses factors both within and outside the classroom (3).

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Increased presynaptic dysfunction measured by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43) may be observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how CSF GAP43 increases relate to AD-core pathologies, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline in AD requires further investigation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 731 older adults with baseline β-amyloid (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET), CSF GAP43, CSF phosphorylated tau181 (p-Tau<sub>181</sub>), and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and longitudinal residual hippocampal volume and cognitive assessments. Among them, 377 individuals had longitudinal <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and 326 individuals had simultaneous longitudinal CSF GAP43, Aβ PET, and CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> data. We compared baseline and slopes of CSF GAP43 among different stages of AD, as well as their associations with Aβ PET, CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>, residual hippocampal volume, <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and cognition cross-sectionally and longitudinally.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Regardless of Aβ positivity and clinical diagnosis, CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>-positive individuals showed higher CSF GAP43 concentrations (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and faster rates of CSF GAP43 increases (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) compared with the CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>-negative individuals. Moreover, higher CSF GAP43 concentrations and faster rates of CSF GAP43 increases were strongly related to CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> independent of Aβ PET. They were related to more rapid hippocampal atrophy, hypometabolism, and cognitive decline (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and predicted the progression from MCI to dementia (area under the curve for baseline 0.704; area under the curve for slope 0.717) over a median 4 years of follow up.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tau aggregations rather than Aβ plaques primarily drive presynaptic dysfunction measured by CSF GAP43, which may lead to sequential neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AD or neurodegenerative diseases. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Midazolam Prevents the Adverse Outcome of Neonatal Asphyxia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Birth asphyxia (BA) is the most frequent cause of neonatal death as well as central nervous system (CNS) injury. BA is often associated with neonatal seizures, which only poorly respond to anti-seizure medications and may contribute to the adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Using a non-invasive rat model of BA, we have recently reported that the potent benzodiazepine, midazolam, prevents neonatal seizures in ~50% of rat pups. In addition to its anti-seizure effect, midazolam exerts anti-inflammatory actions, which is highly relevant for therapeutic intervention following BA. The 2 major aims of the present study were to examine (1) whether midazolam reduces the adverse outcome of BA, and (2) whether this effect is different in rats that did or did not exhibit neonatal seizures after drug treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Behavioral and cognitive tests were performed over 14 months after asphyxia, followed by immunohistochemical analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All vehicle-treated rats had seizures after asphyxia and developed behavioral and cognitive abnormalities, neuroinflammation in gray and white matter, neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and thalamus, and hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting in subsequent months. Administration of midazolam (1 mg/kg i.p.) directly after asphyxia prevented post-asphyctic seizures in ~50% of the rats and resulted in the prevention or decrease of neuroinflammation and the behavioral, cognitive, and neurodegenerative consequences of asphyxia. Except for neurodegeneration in the thalamus, seizures did not seem to contribute to the adverse outcome of asphyxia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The disease-modifying effect of midazolam identified here strongly suggests that this drug provides a valuable option for improving the treatment and outcome of BA. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Rhythmic whisking is a prominent component of rodent behavior. Golomb et al. solve a hierarchical model of the whisking circuitry. The first whisk within a breathing cycle is derived from inhalation; subsequent whisks arise from an all-inhibitory oscillator. This framework supports longstanding observations of concurrent driven and autonomous motor actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive analysis of the human ESCRT-III-MIT domain interactome reveals new cofactors for cytokinetic abscission</a></h4>

              
                The 12 related human ESCRT-III proteins form filaments that constrict membranes and mediate fission, including during cytokinetic abscission. The C-terminal tails of polymerized ESCRT-III subunits also bind proteins that contain Microtubule-Interacting and Trafficking (MIT) domains. MIT domains can interact with ESCRT-III tails in many different ways to create a complex binding code that is used to recruit essential cofactors to sites of ESCRT activity. Here, we have comprehensively and quantitatively mapped the interactions between all known ESCRT-III tails and 19 recombinant human MIT domains. We measured 228 pairwise interactions, quantified 60 positive interactions, and discovered 18 previously unreported interactions. We also report the crystal structure of the SPASTIN MIT domain in complex with the IST1 C-terminal tail. Three MIT enzymes were studied in detail and shown to: (1) localize to cytokinetic midbody membrane bridges through interactions with their specific ESCRT-III binding partners (SPASTIN-IST1, KATNA1-CHMP3, and CAPN7-IST1), (2) function in abscission (SPASTIN, KATNA1, and CAPN7), and (3) function in the ‘NoCut’ abscission checkpoint (SPASTIN and CAPN7). Our studies define the human MIT-ESCRT-III interactome, identify new factors and activities required for cytokinetic abscission and its regulation, and provide a platform for analyzing ESCRT-III and MIT cofactor interactions in all ESCRT-mediated processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">3D optogenetic control of arteriole diameter in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Modulation of brain arteriole diameter is critical for maintaining cerebral blood pressure and controlling regional hyperemia during neural activity. However, studies of hemodynamic function in health and disease have lacked a method to control arteriole diameter independently with high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we describe an all-optical approach to manipulate and monitor brain arteriole contractility in mice in three dimensions using combined in vivo two-photon optogenetics and imaging. The expression of the red-shifted excitatory opsin, ReaChR, in vascular smooth muscle cells enabled rapid and repeated vasoconstriction controlled by brief light pulses. Two-photon activation of ReaChR using a spatial light modulator produced highly localized constrictions when targeted to individual arterioles within the neocortex. We demonstrate the utility of this method for examining arteriole contractile dynamics and creating transient focal blood flow reductions. Additionally, we show that optogenetic constriction can be used to reshape vasodilatory responses to sensory stimulation, providing a valuable tool to dissociate blood flow changes from neural activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rvb1/Rvb2 proteins couple transcription and translation during glucose starvation</a></h4>

              
                During times of unpredictable stress, organisms must adapt their gene expression to maximize survival. Along with changes in transcription, one conserved means of gene regulation during conditions that quickly represses translation is the formation of cytoplasmic phase-separated mRNP granules such as P-bodies and stress granules. Previously, we identified that distinct steps in gene expression can be coupled during glucose starvation as promoter sequences in the nucleus are able to direct the subcellular localization and translatability of mRNAs in the cytosol. Here, we report that Rvb1 and Rvb2, conserved ATPase proteins implicated as protein assembly chaperones and chromatin remodelers, were enriched at the promoters and mRNAs of genes involved in alternative glucose metabolism pathways that we previously found to be transcriptionally upregulated but translationally downregulated during glucose starvation in yeast. Engineered Rvb1/Rvb2-binding on mRNAs was sufficient to sequester mRNAs into mRNP granules and repress their translation. Additionally, this Rvb-tethering to the mRNA drove further transcriptional upregulation of the target genes. Further we found that depletion of Rvb2 caused decreased alternative glucose metabolism gene mRNA induction, but upregulation of protein synthesis during glucose starvation. Overall, our results point to Rvb1/Rvb2 coupling transcription, mRNA granular localization, and translatability of mRNAs during glucose starvation. This Rvb-mediated rapid gene regulation could potentially serve as an efficient recovery plan for cells after stress removal.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reverse engineering of metacognition</a></h4>

              
                The human ability to introspect on thoughts, perceptions or actions − metacognitive ability − has become a focal topic of both cognitive basic and clinical research. At the same time it has become increasingly clear that currently available quantitative tools are limited in their ability to make unconfounded inferences about metacognition. As a step forward, the present work introduces a comprehensive modeling framework of metacognition that allows for inferences about metacognitive noise and metacognitive biases during the readout of decision values or at the confidence reporting stage. The model assumes that confidence results from a continuous but noisy and potentially biased transformation of decision values, described by a confidence link function. A canonical set of metacognitive noise distributions is introduced which differ, amongst others, in their predictions about metacognitive sign flips of decision values. Successful recovery of model parameters is demonstrated, and the model is validated on an empirical data set. In particular, it is shown that metacognitive noise and bias parameters correlate with conventional behavioral measures. Crucially, in contrast to these conventional measures, metacognitive noise parameters inferred from the model are shown to be independent of performance. This work is accompanied by a toolbox (<i>ReMeta</i>) that allows researchers to estimate key parameters of metacognition in confidence datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neurogenic signature involving monoamine oxidase-a controls human thermogenic adipose tissue development</a></h4>

              
                Mechanisms that control 'beige/brite' thermogenic adipose tissue development may be harnessed to improve human metabolic health. To define these mechanisms, we developed a species-hybrid model in which human mesenchymal progenitor cells were used to develop white or thermogenic/beige adipose tissue in mice. The hybrid adipose tissue developed distinctive features of human adipose tissue, such as larger adipocyte size, despite its neurovascular architecture being entirely of murine origin. Thermogenic adipose tissue recruited a denser, qualitatively distinct vascular network, differing in genes mapping to circadian rhythm pathways, and denser sympathetic innervation. The enhanced thermogenic neurovascular network was associated with human adipocyte expression of THBS<i>4</i>, <i>TNC</i>, <i>NTRK3</i> and <i>SPARCL1</i>, which enhance neurogenesis, and decreased expression of <i>MAOA </i>and<i> ACHE</i>, which control neurotransmitter tone. Systemic inhibition of MAOA, which is present in human but absent in mouse adipocytes, induced browning of human but not mouse adipose tissue, revealing the physiological relevance of this pathway. Our results reveal species-specific cell type dependencies controlling the development of thermogenic adipose tissue and point to human adipocyte MAOA as a potential target for metabolic disease therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Shared mechanisms of auditory and non-auditory vocal learning in the songbird brain</a></h4>

              
                Songbirds and humans share the ability to adaptively modify their vocalizations based on sensory feedback. Prior studies have focused primarily on the role that auditory feedback plays in shaping vocal output throughout life. In contrast, it is unclear how non-auditory information drives vocal plasticity. Here, we first used a reinforcement learning paradigm to establish that somatosensory feedback (cutaneous electrical stimulation) can drive vocal learning in adult songbirds. We then assessed the role of a songbird basal ganglia thalamocortical pathway critical to auditory vocal learning in this novel form of vocal plasticity. We found that both this circuit and its dopaminergic inputs are necessary for non-auditory vocal learning, demonstrating that this pathway is critical for guiding adaptive vocal changes based on both auditory and somatosensory signals. The ability of this circuit to use both auditory and somatosensory information to guide vocal learning may reflect a general principle for the neural systems that support vocal plasticity across species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Balance between breadth and depth in human many-alternative decisions</a></h4>

              
                Many everyday life decisions require allocating finite resources, such as attention or time, to examine multiple available options, like choosing an online food supplier. In these cases, our search resources can be spread across many options (breadth) or focused on a few of them (depth). Whilst theoretical work has described how finite resources should be allocated to maximise utility in these problems, evidence about how humans balance breadth and depth is lacking. We introduce a novel experimental paradigm where humans make a many-alternative decision under finite resources. In an imaginary scenario, participants allocate a finite budget to sample amongst multiple apricot suppliers in order to estimate the quality of their fruits, and ultimately choose the best one. We found that at low budget capacity participants sample as many suppliers as possible, and thus prefer breadth, whereas at high capacities participants sample just a few chosen alternatives in depth, and intentionally ignore the rest. The number of alternatives sampled increases with capacity following a power law with an exponent close to 0.75. In richer environments, where good outcomes are more likely, humans further favour depth. Participants deviate from optimality and tend to allocate capacity amongst the selected alternatives more homogeneously than it would be optimal, but the impact on the outcome is small. Overall, our results undercover a rich phenomenology of close-to-optimal behaviour and biases in complex choices.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Murine blastocysts generated by in vitro fertilization show increased Warburg metabolism and altered lactate production</a></h4>

              
                In vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of over 8 million children. Although most of IVF-conceived children are healthy, several studies suggest an increased risk of altered growth rate, cardiovascular dysfunction, and glucose intolerance in this population compared to naturally conceived children. However, a clear understanding of how embryonic metabolism is affected by culture condition and how embryos reprogram their metabolism is unknown. Here, we studied oxidative stress and metabolic alteration in blastocysts conceived by natural mating or by IVF and culture in physiologic (5%) or atmospheric (20%) oxygen. We found that IVF-generated blastocyst manifest increased reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage to DNA/lipid/proteins, and reduction in glutathione. Metabolic analysis revealed IVF-generated blastocysts display decreased mitochondria respiration and increased glycolytic activity suggestive of enhanced Warburg metabolism. These findings were corroborated by altered intracellular and extracellular pH and increased intracellular lactate levels in IVF-generated embryos. Comprehensive proteomic analysis and targeted immunofluorescence showed reduction of LDH-B and MCT1, enzymes involved in lactate metabolism. Importantly, these enzymes remained downregulated in tissues of adult IVF-conceived mice, suggesting that metabolic alterations in IVF-generated embryos may result in alteration in lactate metabolism. These findings suggest that alterations in lactate metabolism is a likely mechanism involved in genomic reprogramming and could be involved in the developmental origin of health and disease.

                A stress adaptation pathway termed the integrated stress response has been suggested to be active in many cancers including prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we demonstrate that the eIF2 kinase GCN2 is required for sustained growth in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant models of PCa both in vitro and in vivo, and is active in PCa patient samples. Using RNA-seq transcriptome analysis and a CRISPR-based phenotypic screen, GCN2 was shown to regulate expression of over 60 solute-carrier (<i>SLC</i>) genes, including those involved in amino acid transport and loss of GCN2 function reduces amino acid import and levels. Addition of essential amino acids or expression of 4F2 (SLC3A2) partially restored growth following loss of GCN2, suggesting that GCN2 targeting of SLC transporters is required for amino acid homeostasis needed to sustain tumor growth. A small molecule inhibitor of GCN2 showed robust in vivo efficacy in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant mouse models of PCa, supporting its therapeutic potential for the treatment of PCa.

                The stability and plasticity of B cell-mediated immune memory ensures the ability to respond to the repeated challenges. We have analyzed the longitudinal dynamics of immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoires from memory B cells, plasmablasts, and plasma cells from the peripheral blood of generally healthy volunteers. We reveal a high degree of clonal persistence in individual memory B cell subsets, with inter-individual convergence in memory and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). ASC clonotypes demonstrate clonal relatedness to memory B cells, and are transient in peripheral blood. We identify two clusters of expanded clonal lineages with differing prevalence of memory B cells, isotypes, and persistence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed signs of reactivation of persisting memory B cell-enriched clonal lineages, accompanied by new rounds of affinity maturation during proliferation and differentiation into ASCs. Negative selection contributes to both persisting and reactivated lineages, preserving the functionality and specificity of BCRs to protect against current and future pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Solute exchange through gap junctions lessens the adverse effects of inactivating mutations in metabolite-handling genes</a></h4>

              
                Growth of cancer cells <i>in vitro</i> can be attenuated by genetically inactivating selected metabolic pathways. However, loss-of-function mutations in metabolic pathways are not negatively selected in human cancers, indicating that these genes are not essential <i>in vivo</i>. We hypothesize that spontaneous mutations in 'metabolic genes' will not necessarily produce functional defects because mutation-bearing cells may be rescued by metabolite exchange with neighboring wild-type cells via gap junctions. Using fluorescent substances to probe inter-cellular diffusion, we show that colorectal cancer (CRC) cells are coupled by gap junctions assembled from connexins, particularly Cx26. Cells with genetically inactivated components of pH regulation (<i>SLC9A1</i>), glycolysis (<i>ALDOA</i>), or mitochondrial respiration (<i>NDUFS1</i>) could be rescued through access to functional proteins in co-cultured wild-type cells. The effect of diffusive coupling was also observed in co-culture xenografts. Rescue was largely dependent on solute exchange via Cx26 channels, a uniformly and constitutively expressed isoform in CRCs. Due to diffusive coupling, the emergent phenotype is less heterogenous than its genotype, and thus an individual cell should not be considered as the unit under selection, at least for metabolite-handling processes. Our findings can explain why certain loss-of-function mutations in genes ascribed as 'essential' do not influence the growth of human cancers.

                Multidisciplinary evidence suggests that instrumental performance is governed by two major forms of behavioural control: goal-directed and autonomous processes. Brain-state abnormalities affecting the striatum, such as ageing, often shift control towards autonomous - habit-like - behaviour, although the neural mechanisms responsible for this shift remain unknown. Here, combining instrumental conditioning with cell-specific functional mapping and manipulation in striatal neurons, we explored strategies that invigorate goal-directed action capacity in aged mice. In animals performing instrumental actions, D2- and D1-neurons of the aged striatum were engaged in a characteristically counterbalanced manner, something that related to the propensity to express autonomous behaviour. Long-lasting, cell-specific desensitisation of D2-neurons in aged transgenic mice recapitulated the uneven D2- to D1-neuron functional correspondence observed in young mice, an effect that enabled successful goal-directed action. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the neural bases of behavioural control and propose neural system interventions that enhance cognitive functioning in habit-prone brains.

                Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and arise from yolk sac-derived macrophages during early embryogenesis. On entering the brain, microglia undergo in situ proliferation and eventually colonise the entire brain by the second and third postnatal weeks in mice. However, the intricate dynamics of their developmental expansion remain unclear. Here, we examine and characterise the proliferative dynamics of microglia during embryonic and postnatal development. Using complementary fate-mapping techniques, we demonstrate that the developmental colonisation of the brain by microglia is facilitated by clonal expansion of highly proliferative microglial progenitors that occupy spatial niches throughout the brain. We also find that the distribution of microglia switches from a clustered to a random pattern between embryonic and late postnatal development. Moreover, the developmental increase in microglia follows the proportional growth of the brain in an allometric manner with the density of microglia eventually stabilising when the mosaic distribution has been established. Overall, our findings offer insight into how the competition for space acts as a driving force for microglial colonisation by clonal expansion during development.

                Stem cell technologies provide new opportunities for modeling cells in the healthy and diseased states and for regenerative medicine. In both cases developmental knowledge as well as the quality and molecular properties of the cells are essential for their future application. In this study we identify developmental factors important for the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. We found that Laminin-511, and dual canonical and non-canonical WNT activation followed by GSK3b inhibition plus FGF8b, improved midbrain patterning. In addition, mDA neurogenesis and differentiation was enhanced by activation of liver X receptors and inhibition of fibroblast growth factor signaling. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a developmental dynamics similar to that of the endogenous human ventral midbrain and the emergence of high quality molecularly-defined midbrain cell types, including mDA neurons that become functional. Thus, our study identifies novel factors important for human midbrain development and opens the door for a future application of molecularly-defined hESC-derived midbrain cell types in Parkinsons disease.

                Mammalian prion diseases are fatal and transmissible neurological conditions caused by the propagation of prions, self-replicating multimeric assemblies of misfolded forms of host cellular prion protein (PrP). The most common human form of the disease, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), typically presents as a rapidly progressive dementia and has no effective treatments. Prion diseases are transmissible to laboratory rodents affording unprecedented opportunities to understand neurodegeneration in its evolving stages. Murine models are especially useful in prion research as they develop bona fide prion disease and recapitulate all biochemical and neuropathological hallmarks of human prion disease. Despite extensive studies investigating the changes in transcriptional profiles in prion diseases the mechanisms by which prion diseases induce cellular toxicity, including changes in gene expression profiles are yet to be fully characterized. This is at least in part because confounding effects related to brain cellular heterogeneity have not been resolved. Here, we took advantage of the recent developments in single-cell technologies and performed an unbiased whole-transcriptome single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis in prion disease.

                Neuromorphic chips are well-suited for the exploration of neuronal dynamics in (near) real-time. In order to port existing research onto these chips, relevant models of neuronal and synaptic dynamics first need to be supported by their respective development environments and validated against existing simulator backends. At the time of writing, support for short-term synaptic plasticity on neuromorphic hardware is scarce. This technical paper proposes an implementation of dynamic synapses for the SpiNNaker development environment based on the popular synaptic plasticity model by Tsodyks and Markram (TM). This extension is undertaken in the context of existing research on neuromodulation and the study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) effects on singular-neuron responses. The implementation of the TM synapse is first detailed and then, simulated for various response types. Its role in studies of DBS effect on postsynaptic responses is also reviewed. Finally, given the real-time capabilities offered by the hardware, we provide some insights to lay the groundwork for future explorations of closed-loop DBS on neuromorphic chips.

When analyzing EEG data, especially in the mobile context, removing samples regarded as artifactual is a common approach before computing independent component analysis (ICA). Automatic tools for this exist, such as the automatic sample rejection of the AMICA algorithm (Palmer et al., 2011), but the impact of both movement intensity and the automatic sample rejection has not been systematically evaluated yet. Approach. We computed AMICA decompositions on eight data sets from six open-access studies with varying degrees of movement intensities using increasingly conservative sample rejection criteria. We evaluated the subsequent decomposition quality in terms of the component mutual information, the amount of brain, muscle, and "other" components, the residual variance of the brain components, and an exemplary signal-to-noise ratio. Main results. We found that increasing movements of participants led to decreasing decomposition quality for individual data sets but not as a general trend across all movement intensities. The cleaning strength had less impact on decomposition results than anticipated, and moderate cleaning of the data resulted in the best decompositions. Significance. Our results indicate that the AMICA algorithm is very robust even with limited data cleaning. Moderate amounts of cleaning such as 5 to 10 iterations of the AMICA sample rejection with 3 standard deviations as the threshold will likely improve the decomposition of most data sets, irrespective of the movement intensity.

                Retromer controls cellular homeostasis through regulating integral membrane protein sorting and transport and by controlling late-stage maturation of the endo-lysosomal network. Retromer dysfunction, which is linked to neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases, manifests in complex cellular phenotypes, though the precise nature of this dysfunction, and its relation to neurodegeneration, remain unclear. Here, we perform the first integrated multiomics approach to provide precise insight into the impact of Retromer dysfunction on endo-lysosomal health and homeostasis within a human neuroglioma cell model. We quantify profound changes to the lysosomal proteome, indicative of broad lysosomal dysfunction and inefficient autophagic lysosome reformation, coupled with a reconfigured cell surface proteome and secretome reflective of increased lysosomal exocytosis. Through this global proteomic approach and parallel transcriptomic analysis, we provide an unprecedented integrated view of Retromer function in regulating lysosomal homeostasis and emphasise its role in neuroprotection.

                Proactive cognition brain models are mainstream nowadays. Within these, preparation is understood as an endogenous, top-down function that takes place prior to the actual perception of a stimulus and improves subsequent behavior. Neuroimaging has uncovered the existence of such preparatory activity in different cognitive domains, however no research to date has sought to uncover their potential similarities and differences. Two of these domains, often confounded in the literature, are Selective Attention (information relevance) and Perceptual Expectation (information probability). We used EEG to characterize the mechanisms that support preparation in Attention and Expectation. In different blocks, participants were cued to the relevance or to the probability of target categories, faces vs. names in a gender discrimination task. Multivariate Pattern (MVPA) and Representational Similarity Analyses (RSA) during the preparation window showed that both manipulations led to a significant, ramping-up prediction of the relevant or expected target category. However, classifiers trained on data from one condition did not generalize to the other, indicating the existence of different anticipatory neural patterns. Further analyses pointed to a differential involvement of specific frequency bands in each condition. Finally, a Canonical Template Tracking procedure showed that there was stronger perceptual reinstatement for Attention than for Expectation. Overall, results indicate that preparation during attention and expectation acts through different, although partially overlapping, neural mechanisms. These findings have important implications for current models of brain functioning, as they are a first step towards characterizing and dissociating the neural mechanisms involved in top-down anticipatory processing.

                In humans and animals, surprise is a physiological reaction to an unexpected event, but how surprise can be linked to plausible models of neuronal activity is an open problem. We propose a self-supervised spiking neural network model where a surprise signal is extracted from an increase in neural activity after an imbalance of excitation and inhibition. The surprise signal modulates synaptic plasticity via a three-factor learning rule which increases plasticity at moments of surprise. The surprise signal remains small when transitions between sensory events follow a previously learned rule but increases immediately after rule switching. In our model, previously learned rules are protected against overwriting when learning a new rule. Our surprise-modulated spiking network model makes a step towards solving the stability-plasticity dilemma in neuroscience and the problem of continual learning in machine learning.

                Recent work within neuroimaging consortia have aimed to identify reproducible, and often subtle, brain signatures of psychiatric or neurological conditions. To allow for high-powered brain imaging analyses, it is often necessary to pool MR images that were acquired with different protocols across multiple scanners. Current retrospective harmonization techniques have shown promise in removing cross-site image variation. However, most statistical approaches may over-correct for technical, scanning-related, variation as they cannot distinguish between confounded image-acquisition based variability and cross-site population variability. Such statistical methods often require that datasets contain subjects or patient groups with similar clinical or demographic information to isolate the acquisition-based variability. To overcome this limitation, we consider cross-site MRI image harmonization as a style transfer problem rather than a domain transfer problem. Using a fully unsupervised deep-learning framework based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), we show that MR images can be harmonized by inserting the style information encoded from a single reference image, without knowing their site/scanner labels a priori. We trained our model using data from five large-scale multi-site datasets with varied demographics. Results demonstrated that our style-encoding model can harmonize MR images, and match intensity profiles, without relying on traveling subjects. This model also avoids the need to control for clinical, diagnostic, or demographic information. We highlight the effectiveness of our method for clinical research by comparing extracted cortical and subcortical features, brain-age estimates, and case-control effect sizes before and after the harmonization. We showed that our harmonization removed the cross-site variances, while preserving the anatomical information and clinical meaningful patterns. We further demonstrated that with a diverse training set, our method successfully harmonized MR images collected from unseen scanners and protocols, suggesting a promising novel tool for ongoing collaborative studies. Source code is released in USC-IGC/style_transfer_harmonization (github.com).

                In order to navigate through the environment, humans must be able to measure both the distance traveled in space, and the interval covered in time. Yet, how these two dimensions are computed and interact across neural systems remains unknown. One possibility is that subjects measure how far and how long they have traveled relative to a known reference point, or anchor. To measure this, we had human participants (n=24) perform a distance estimation task in a virtual environment in which they were cued to attend to either the spatial or temporal interval traveled, while responses were measured with multiband fMRI. We observed that both dimensions evoked similar frontoparietal networks, yet with striking rostrocaudal dissociation between temporal and spatial estimation. Multivariate classifiers trained on each dimension were further able to predict the temporal or spatial interval traveled, with center of activation within the supplementary motor area (SMA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) for time and space, respectively. Further, a cross-classification approach revealed the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and occipital place area (OPA) as regions capable of decoding the general magnitude of traveled distance. Altogether, our findings suggest the brain uses separate systems for tracking spatial and temporal distance, which are combined together along with amodal estimates.

                Myelin is a multi-layered membrane that tightly wraps neuronal axons enabling efficient, high-speed signal propagation. The axon and myelin sheath form tight contacts, mediated by specific plasma membrane proteins and lipids, and disruption of these contacts causes devastating demyelinating diseases. Using two cell-based models of demyelinating sphingolipidoses, we demonstrate that altered lipid metabolism changes the abundance of specific plasma membrane proteins. These altered membrane proteins have known roles in cell adhesion and signalling, with several implicated in neurological diseases. The cell surface abundance of the adhesion molecule Neurofascin, a protein critical for the maintenance of myelin-axon contacts, changes following disruption to sphingolipid metabolism. This provides a direct molecular link between altered lipid abundance and myelin stability. We show that the Neurofascin isoform NF155, but not NF186, interacts directly and specifically with the sphingolipid sulfatide via multiple binding sites and that this interaction requires the full-length extracellular domain of NF155. We demonstrate that NF155 adopts an S-shaped conformation and preferrentially binds sulfatide-containing membranes in cis, with important implications for protein arrangement in the tight axon-myelin space. Our work links glycosphingolipid imbalances to disturbance of membrane protein abundance and demonstrates how this may be driven by direct protein-lipid interactions, providing a mechanistic framework to understand the pathogenesis of galactosphingolipidoses.

                Previous studies have demonstrated that transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) with noninvasive high penetration and high spatial resolution has an effective neuromodulatory effect on neurological diseases. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that severely affects child health. However, the neuromodulatory effects of TUS on ADHD have not been reported to date. To reveal the neuromodulatory effects, TUS was performed in ADHD model rats for 2 consecutive weeks, and the behavioral improvement of ADHD, neural activity of ADHD from neurons and neural oscillation levels, and the plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brains of ADHD rats were evaluated. The results showed that TUS can improve cognitive behavior in ADHD rats, and that TUS altered neuronal firing patterns and modulated the relative power and sample entropy of local field potentials in an ADHD rat model. In addition, TUS can also enhance BDNF expression in the brain tissue of the ADHD rat model. In conclusion, TUS has an effective neuromodulatory effect on ADHD and thus has the potential to clinically improve cognitive dysfunction in ADHD.

                The dentate gyrus, a gateway for input to the hippocampal formation, arises from progenitors in the medial telencephalic neuroepithelium adjacent to the cortical hem. Dentate progenitors navigate a complex migratory path guided by two cell populations that arise from the hem, the fimbrial glia, and Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells. Since the hem expresses multiple Wnt genes, we examined whether {beta}-CATENIN, which mediates canonical Wnt signaling and also participates in cell adhesion, is necessary for the development of hem-derived lineages. We report that the fimbrial glial scaffold is disorganized and CR cells are mispositioned upon hem-specific disruption of {beta}-CATENIN. Consequently, the dentate migratory stream is severely affected, and the dentate gyrus fails to form. Using selective Cre drivers, we further determined that {beta}-CATENIN function is required in the fimbrial glial scaffold, but not in the CR cells, for guiding the dentate migration. Our findings highlight a primary requirement for {beta}-CATENIN for the organization of the fimbrial scaffold and a secondary role for this factor in dentate gyrus morphogenesis.

                Long-term plasticity is the primary mode of synaptic weight updating. However, other updating modes include modification of synaptic connections across neurons. The synaptic competition found during adult neurogenesis is an example. In this process, adult-born neurons are integrated into the existing neuronal pool by competing with mature neurons for synaptic connections from the entorhinal cortex. Evidence suggests that adult neurogenesis is critical for discriminating similar memories, i.e., memories with considerable interferences. This computational study aims to link synaptic competition with pattern separation. We show that synaptic competition and neuronal maturation are crucial for separating considerably overlapping memory patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a feed-forward neural network trained by a competition-based learning rule can outperform a multi-layer perceptron trained by the backpropagation algorithm, especially when the sample size is small. These results unveil the functional implications and potential applications of synaptic competition in neural computation.

                Decades of neuroscientific research has sought to understand medial temporal lobe (MTL) involvement in perception. The field has historically relied on qualitative accounts of perceptual processing (e.g. descriptions of stimuli), in order to interpret evidence across subjects, experiments, and species. Here we use stimulus computable methods to formalize MTL-dependent visual behaviors. We draw from a series of experiments administered to monkeys with bilateral lesions that include perirhinal cortex (PRC), an MTL structure implicated in visual object perception. These stimuli were designed to maximize a qualitative perceptual property ('feature ambiguity') considered relevant to PRC function. We formalize perceptual demands imposed by these stimuli using a computational proxy for the primate ventral visual stream (VVS). When presented with the same images administered to experimental subjects, this VVS model predicts both PRC-intact and -lesioned choice behaviors; a linear readout of the VVS should be sufficient for performance on these tasks. Given the absence of PRC-related deficits on these 'ambiguous' stimuli, we originally concluded that PRC is not involved in perception. Here we reevaluate this claim. By situating these data alongside computational results from multiple studies administered to humans with naturally occurring PRC lesions, this work offers the first formal, cross-species evaluation of MTL involvement in perception. In doing so, we contribute to a growing understanding of visual processing that depends on---and is independent of---the MTL.

Homeostatic plasticity (HSP), serving to increase neural activity as compensation for the reduced input to the auditory pathway after hearing loss, has been proposed as causal mechanism underlying tinnitus. In support, animal models of tinnitus show evidence of increased neural activity after hearing loss, including increased spontaneous and sound-driven firing rate, as well as increased neural noise throughout the auditory processing pathway. Bridging these findings to human tinnitus, however, has proven to be challenging. Here we implement hearing loss-induced HSP in a Wilson-Cowan Cortical Model of the auditory cortex to predict how homeostatic principles operating at the microscale translate to the meso- to macroscale accessible through human neuroimaging. We observed HSP-induced response changes in the model that were previously proposed as neural signatures of tinnitus. As expected, HSP increased spontaneous and sound-driven responsiveness in hearing-loss affected frequency channels of the model. We furthermore observed evidence of increased neural noise and the appearance of spatiotemporal modulations in neural activity, which we discuss in light of recent human neuroimaging findings. Our computational model makes quantitative predictions that require experimental validation, and may thereby serve as the basis of future human tinnitus studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A critical period for neurogenesis loss and cognitive decline in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients</a></h4>

              
                Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is a syndromic disorder presenting with seizures and cognitive comorbidities. The cellular mechanisms contributing to epilepsy progression are not well understood. Here we show that intelligence, verbal learning, and memory decline at a critical period when hippocampal neurogenesis becomes undetectable. Individual patient analysis revealed that the number of immature neurons, rather than total granule neurons, particularly benefit verbal learning. These results illustrate a functional role for adult human neurogenesis and reveal a therapeutic target accompanying cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The coarse mental map of the breast is anchored on the nipple</a></h4>

              
                The sense of touch plays a key role in our experience of our body and our interactions with the world, from the objects we manipulate to the people we touch. While tactile sensibility and its neural basis have been extensively characterized for the glabrous skin of the hand, much less is known about touch on other parts of the body. Despite the important role of the breast in affective touch, mediating the feel of a hug, and in sexual function, as one of the principal erogenous zones, little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of the breast and compared it to that of the hand and back, body regions that span the range of tactile spatial acuity. First, we had subjects judge the relative locations of two consecutive touches on the breast, hand, or back. We found that the tactile acuity of the breast was far lower than that of the hand, and even lower than that of the back, heretofore the paragon of poor acuity. Furthermore, breast acuity decreased with breast size, consistent with the hypothesis that innervation capacity does not scale with body size. Second, we showed that touches to different regions of the nipple were largely indistinguishable, suggesting that the nipple is a sensory unit. Finally, we examined the ability of subjects to report the location of touches on a three-dimensional model of their breast and found localization errors to be systematically biased toward the nipple.

                The cellular diversity and complex organization of the brain have hindered systematic characterization of age-related changes in its cellular and molecular architecture, limiting our ability to understand the mechanisms underlying its functional decline during aging. Here we generated a high-resolution cell atlas of brain aging within the frontal cortex and striatum using spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics and quantified the changes in gene expression and spatial organization of major cell types in these brain regions over the lifespan of mice. We observed substantially more pronounced changes in the composition, gene expression and spatial organization of non-neuronal cells over neurons. Our data revealed molecular and spatial signatures of glial and immune cell activation during aging, particularly enriched in subcortical white matter, and identified both similarities and notable differences in cell activation patterns induced by aging and systemic inflammatory challenge. These results provide critical insights into age-related decline and inflammation in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling communication and switching nonlinear dynamics in multi-region neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how multiple brain regions interact to produce behavior is a major challenge in systems neuroscience, with many regions causally implicated in common tasks such as sensory processing and decision making. However, a precise description of interactions between regions remains an open problem. Moreover, neural dynamics are nonlinear, non-stationary, and can vary dramatically across sessions, days, and animals. Here, we propose multi-region, switching dynamical systems (MR-SDS), a probabilistic model of multiple latent interacting systems that evolve with switching nonlinear dynamics and communication between regions. MR-SDS includes directed interactions between brain regions, allowing for estimation of state-dependent communication signals, and accounts for sensory inputs effects, history effects, and heterogeneity across days and animals. We show that our model accurately recovers latent trajectories, vector fields underlying switching nonlinear dynamics, and cross-region communication profiles in two simulations. We then apply our method to two large-scale, multi-region neural datasets involving mouse decision making. The first includes hundreds of neurons per region, recorded simultaneously at single-cell-resolution across 3 distant cortical regions. The second is a mesoscale widefield dataset of 8 adjacent cortical regions imaged across both hemispheres. On these multi-region datasets, our model outperforms existing piece-wise linear multi-region models and reveals multiple distinct dynamical states and a rich set of cross-region communication profiles.

                Recently, there has been increased interest in the role of the cerebellum in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In order to better understand the pathophysiological role of the cerebellum in ASD, it is necessary to have a variety of mouse models that have face validity for cerebellar disruption in humans. Here, we add to the literature on the cerebellum transgenic and induced mouse models of autism with the characterization of the cerebellum in the BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) inbred mouse strain, which has behavioral phenotypes that are suggestive of ASD in patients. When we examined both male and female adult BTBR mice in comparison to C57BL/6J (C57) controls, we noted that both mice showed motor coordination deficits characteristic of cerebellar function, but only the male mice showed differences in delay eyeblink conditioning, a cerebellum-dependent learning task that is also disrupted in ASD patients. Both male and female BTBR mice showed considerable expansion of and abnormal foliation in the cerebellum vermis--including significant expansion of specific lobules in the anterior cerebellum. In addition, we found a slight but significant decrease in Purkinje cell density in both male and female BTBR mice, irrespective of lobule. Furthermore, there was a marked reduction of Purkinje cell dendritic spines density in both male and female BTBR mice. These findings suggest that, for the most part, the BTBR mouse model successfully phenocopies many of the characteristics of the subpopulation of ASD patients that have a hypertrophic cerebellum. We discuss the significance of sex differences--revealed for the first time in BTBR mice, and present in only a small number of cerebellum studies--and the importance of concordance on other metrics between male and female BTBR mice.

	<p>Gasdermin D-executing pyroptosis mediated by NLRP3 inflammasomes has been recognized as a key pathogenesis during stroke. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could protect CNS against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced neuroinflammation, while the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The study applied the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model to investigate how the brain and the retinal injuries were alleviated in sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS)-treated rats. The rats were assigned to four groups and received an intraperitoneal injection of 50 &amp;amp;mu;mol/kg NaHS or NaCl 15 min after surgery. Neurological deficits were evaluated using the modified neurologic severity score. The quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD were determined by ELISA and Western blot. Cortical and retinal neurodegeneration and cell pyroptosis were determined by histopathologic examination. Results showed that NaHS rescued post-stroke neurological deficits and infarct progression, improved retina injury, and attenuated neuroinflammation in the brain cortexes and the retinae. NaHS administration inhibits inflammation by blocking the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway and further suppressing neuronal pyroptosis. This is supported by the fact that it reversed the high-level of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD following I/R. Our findings suggest that compounds with the ability to donate H2S could constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.</p>

	<p>Background: Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that often causes depression. Early life experience affects brain development and relates to depression. Whether the effect of different MS protocols in early life on anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in female offspring with imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis is unknown. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were subjected to no separation (NMS), brief MS (15 min/day, MS15) or long MS (180 min/day, MS180) from postpartum days (PPD) 1 to PPD21. Then, 5% imiquimod cream was applied for 8 days in adults. Behavioral tests, skin lesions and hippocampal protein expression were also assessed. Results: We found significant psoriasis-like skin lesions in female mice following IMQ application, and mice showed anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors. Further, increased microglial activation and decreased expression of neuroplasticity were detected in mice following IMQ application. However, after MS15 in early life, mice showed decreased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, indicating resilience. Further, inhibited hippocampal neuroinflammation and increased neuroplasticity were detected. Conclusions: Collectively, this study confirms that brief MS confers resilience to the behavior deficits in female offspring with IMQ-induced psoriasis and reverses the activation of neuroinflammation and the damage of neuroplasticity injury.</p>

	<p>Visual-motor illusion (VMI) is an intervention to induce kinesthetic sensation from visual stimuli. We aimed to compare the effects of VMI of different visual stimuli on the paralyzed side ankle joint of stroke hemiplegic patients (hemiplegic patients) and to clarify their indication. We applied two types of VMI images of ankle dorsiflexion: ankle dorsiflexion without resistance (standard VMI (S-VMI)) and maximum effort dorsiflexion with resistance (power VMI (P-VMI)). Twenty-two hemiplegic patients were divided into two groups: Group A, which received S-VMI first and P-VMI one week later (n = 11), and Group B, which received P-VMI first and S-VMI one week later (n = 11). Immediate effects were evaluated. Outcomes were the dorsiflexion angle and angular velocity, degree of sense of agency (SoA), and sense of ownership. Patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s characteristics of cognitive flexibility were assessed using the Trail making test-B (TMT-B). Fugl-Meyer assessment and the Composite-Spasticity-Scale were also assessed. P-VMI was significantly higher than S-VMI in SoA and dorsiflexion angular velocity. Additionally, the degree of improvement in dorsiflexion function with P-VMI was related to TMT-B and degree of muscle tone. Therefore, P-VMI improves ankle function in hemiplegic patients more than S-VMI but should be performed with cognitive flexibility and degree of muscle tone in mind.</p>

	<p>The limbic system describes a complex of brain structures central for memory, learning, as well as goal directed and emotional behavior. In addition to pathological studies, recent findings using in vivo structural and functional imaging of the brain pinpoint the vulnerability of limbic structures to neurodegeneration in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) throughout the disease course. Accordingly, dysfunction of the limbic system is critically related to the symptom complex which characterizes PD, including neuropsychiatric, vegetative, and motor symptoms, and their heterogeneity in patients with PD. The aim of this systematic review was to put the spotlight on neuroimaging of the limbic system in PD and to give an overview of the most important structures affected by the disease, their function, disease related alterations, and corresponding clinical manifestations. PubMed was searched in order to identify the most recent studies that investigate the limbic system in PD with the help of neuroimaging methods. First, PD related neuropathological changes and corresponding clinical symptoms of each limbic system region are reviewed, and, finally, a network integration of the limbic system within the complex of PD pathology is discussed.</p>

	<p>We standardized a model by injecting Ehrlich tumor cells into the paw to evaluate cancer pain mechanisms and pharmacological treatments. Opioid treatment, but not cyclooxygenase inhibitor or tricyclic antidepressant treatments reduces Ehrlich tumor pain. To best use this model for drug screening it is essential to understand its pathophysiological mechanisms. Herein, we investigated the contribution of the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) in the Ehrlich tumor-induced pain model. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons from the Ehrlich tumor mice presented higher activity (calcium levels using fluo-4 fluorescent probe) and an increased response to capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist) than the saline-injected animals (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). We also observed diminished mechanical (electronic von Frey) and thermal (hot plate) hyperalgesia, paw flinching, and normalization of weight distribution imbalance in TRPV1 deficient mice (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). On the other hand, TRPV1 deficiency did not alter paw volume or weight, indicating no significant alteration in tumor growth. Intrathecal injection of AMG9810 (TRPV1 antagonist) reduced ongoing Ehrlich tumor-triggered mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Therefore, the contribution of TRPV1 to Ehrlich tumor pain behavior was revealed by genetic and pharmacological approaches, thus, supporting the use of this model to investigate TRPV1-targeting therapies for the treatment of cancer pain.</p>

	<p>Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide involved in human social behaviors and reproduction. Non-invasive OT levels in saliva have recently roused interest as it does not require a specialized medical setting. Here, we observed one woman&amp;amp;rsquo;s basal serum and saliva OT from pregnancy to 1 year postpartum to track OT concentration changes over this period. We examined the changes in salivary OT levels over time in response to maternal physiological and behavioral responses. The fluctuation of saliva OT levels is well correlated with serum OT during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, while salivary OT increased rapidly during direct interaction (social interaction tests) with the infant and/or when the mother was watching her own infant&amp;amp;rsquo;s video (video tests), no increase was observed in serum. We used social interaction and video tests on a group of mothers (nine mothers for social interaction and six for the video test) to clarify these single-subject results. In both tests, the mothers had increased OT in their saliva but not serum. Our study may suggest that salivary samples reflect not only the physical but also the emotional state and that saliva samples may be useful for monitoring women&amp;amp;rsquo;s OT levels during pre- and postpartum periods. Further studies with larger sample numbers are necessary to confirm the rapid changes in salivary OT levels in response to maternal physiological and behavioral responses.</p>

<p>This study shows for the first time that itch mediator gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is expressed in both trigeminal ganglion (TG) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is expressed in both the dorsal horn of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and spinal cord of primates, Japanese macaque monkeys, similar to rodents and Eulipotyphla.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor (GRPR) have been identified as itch mediators in the spinal and trigeminal somatosensory systems in rodents. In primates, there are few reports of GRP/GRPR expression or function in the spinal sensory system and virtually nothing is known in the trigeminal system. The aim of the present study was to characterize GRP and GRPR in the trigeminal and spinal somatosensory system of Japanese macaque monkeys (<i>Macaca fuscata</i>). cDNA encoding <i>GRP</i> was isolated from the macaque dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and exhibited an amino acid sequence that was highly conserved among mammals and especially in primates. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that GRP was expressed mainly in the small-sized trigeminal ganglion and DRG in adult macaque monkeys. Densely stained GRP-immunoreactive (ir) fibers were observed in superficial layers of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and the spinal cord. In contrast, GRP-ir fibers were rarely observed in the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus and oral and interpolar divisions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. cDNA cloning, in situ hybridization, and Western blot revealed substantial expression of <i>GRPR</i> mRNA and GRPR protein in the macaque spinal dorsal horn and Sp5C. Our Western ligand blot and ligand derivative stain for GRPR revealed that GRP directly bound in the macaque Sp5C and spinal dorsal horn as reported in rodents. Finally, GRP-ir fibers were also detected in the human spinal dorsal horn. The spinal and trigeminal itch neural circuits labeled with GRP and GRPR appear to function also in primates.</p>

<p>In addition to their auditory nerve inputs, we show that T-stellate cells within a given isofrequency lamina provide a second modulatable monosynaptic excitatory input to other T-stellate cells as well as to inhibitory L- and D-stellate cells. This circuit may play a significant role in acoustic information processing. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>T-stellate cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) are known to have local axon collaterals that terminate in the vicinity of their dendrites and cell bodies within the same isofrequency lamina in parallel with the auditory nerve fibers that innervate them. Excitatory synaptic connections between stellate cells within an isofrequency lamina are hypothesized to be involved in the nitric oxide-mediated upregulation of T-stellate responses to their auditory input. This could serve as a mechanism of variable gain control in the enhancement of responses to vowel spectral peaks. Previous studies have provided indirect evidence for these possible synaptic interconnections between T-stellate cells, but unequivocal identification has yet to be established. Here, we used retrograde neuronal tracing with adeno-associated viral vector or biotinylated dextran amine injected into the inferior colliculus (IC) to detect the postsynaptic target of T-stellate cells within the VCN. We show that backfilled T-stellate cell axons make monosynapatic connections on the labeled cell bodies and dendrites of other labeled T-stellate cells within an isofrequency lamina. Electron microscopy revealed that T-stellate terminals can also make synapses on structures not retrogradely labeled from the IC. Glycine antibodies combined with the viral labeling indicated that these nonbackfilled structures that the labeled T-stellate terminals were synapsing on are most likely the cell bodies and dendrites of two size categories of glycinergic VCN cells, whose sizes and relative numbers indicated they are the D- and L-stellate cells. These cells are known to provide inhibitory inputs back onto T-stellate cells. Our data indicate that, in addition to their auditory nerve input, T-stellate cells provide a second modulatable excitatory input to both inhibitory and excitatory cells in a VCN isofrequency lamina and may play a significant role in acoustic information processing.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The LXRs agonist GW3965 ameliorates chronic unpredictable stress-induced depression-like behaviors. LXRs agonist treatment can inhibit hippocampal neuroinflammation of CUS model mice, reverse the increase in the number of Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells in the hippocampal subregions, inhibit the activation of microglia in hippocampal CA2/3 and DG regions, and significantly increase the branch length and endpoints of microglia in the DG of CUS model mice. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Liver X receptors (LXRs) have recently been reported to be novel and potential targets for the reversal of depressive-like behaviors, but the mechanism remains unclear. Hippocampal neuroinflammation and impairment of the normal structure and function of microglia are closely associated with depression. To investigate the effects of LXRs agonist (GW3965) on neuroinflammation and microglia in the hippocampal formation of mice with chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression, depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by behavioral tests, hippocampal LXRs gene expression were evaluated by qRT-PCR, the protein expression levels of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor kappa B, and cluster of differentiation 206 were estimated by western blotting, modern stereological methods were used to precisely quantify the total number of microglia in each hippocampal subregion, and immunofluorescence was used to detect the density of activated microglia and the morphology of microglia. We found that GW3965 alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by CUS, reversed the decrease in hippocampal LXRα and LXRβ induced by CUS, increased the protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors, and decreased the protein expression of antiinflammatory factors induced by CUS. Moreover, CUS intervention significantly increased the number of microglia in the CA1 region, CA2/3 region, and dentate gyrus and the density of activated microglia in the CA2/3 region and dentate gyrus and significantly decreased the endpoints of microglial branches and process length of microglia in the dentate gyrus, while 4 weeks of injections with GW3965 reversed these changes. These findings suggest that regulating the number, activated state, and morphology of microglia in hippocampal subregions might be an important basis for the antidepressant effects of LXRs.</p>

     alt="Oxytocin receptors are widely distributed in the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) brain: Relation to social behavior, genetic polymorphisms, and the dopamine system"/>
<p>Graphical Abstract: Using RNAscope in situ hybridization, we comprehensively mapped oxytocin receptor mRNA throughout the prairie vole brain. A comparison of mRNA and protein localization revealed localized mismatches suggesting both pre- and postsynaptic functions for oxytocin receptors (OXTRs). Coexpression of Oxtr mRNA with D1/D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens was also examined.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oxytocin regulates social behavior via direct modulation of neurons, regulation of neural network activity, and interaction with other neurotransmitter systems. The behavioral effects of oxytocin signaling are determined by the species-specific distribution of brain oxytocin receptors. The socially monogamous prairie vole has been a useful model organism for elucidating the role of oxytocin in social behaviors, including pair bonding, response to social loss, and consoling. However, there has been no comprehensive mapping of oxytocin receptor-expressing cells throughout the prairie vole brain. Here, we employed a highly sensitive in situ hybridization, RNAscope, to construct an exhaustive, brain-wide map of oxytocin receptor mRNA-expressing cells. We found that oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was widespread and diffused throughout the brain, with specific areas displaying a particularly robust expression. Comparing receptor binding with mRNA revealed that regions of the hippocampus and substantia nigra contained oxytocin receptor protein but lacked mRNA, indicating that oxytocin receptors can be transported to distal neuronal processes, consistent with presynaptic oxytocin receptor functions. In the nucleus accumbens, a region involved in oxytocin-dependent social bonding, oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was detected in both the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing subtypes of cells. Furthermore, natural genetic polymorphisms robustly influenced oxytocin receptor expression in both D1 and D2 receptor cell types in the nucleus accumbens. Collectively, our findings further elucidate the extent to which oxytocin signaling is capable of influencing brain-wide neural activity, responses to social stimuli, and social behavior.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>
<p>Oxytocin receptor mRNA is diffusely expressed throughout the brain, with strong expression concentrated in certain areas involved in social behavior.</p>
<p>Oxytocin receptor mRNA expression and protein localization are misaligned in some areas, indicating that the receptor protein may be transported to distal processes.</p>
<p>In the nucleus accumbens, oxytocin receptors are expressed on cells expressing both D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, and the majority of variation in oxytocin receptor expression between animals is attributable to polymorphisms in the oxytocin receptor gene.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central melanocortin system is fundamentally important for controlling food intake and energy homeostasis. Melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) is one of two major receptors of the melanocortin system found in the brain. In contrast to the well-characterized melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), little is known regarding the organization of MC3R-expressing neural circuits. To increase our understanding of the intrinsic organization of MC3R neural circuits, identify specific differences between males and females, and gain a neural systems level perspective of this circuitry, we conducted a brain-wide mapping of neurons labeled for MC3R and characterized the distribution of their projections. Analysis revealed MC3R neuronal and terminal labeling in multiple brain regions that control a diverse range of physiological functions and behavioral processes. Notably, dense labeling was observed in the hypothalamus, as well as areas that share considerable connections with the hypothalamus, including the cortex, amygdala, thalamus, and brainstem. Additionally, MC3R neuronal labeling was sexually dimorphic in several areas, including the anteroventral periventricular area, arcuate nucleus, principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and ventral premammillary region. Altogether, anatomical evidence reported here suggests that MC3R has the potential to influence several different classes of motivated behavior that are essential for survival, including ingestive, reproductive, defensive, and arousal behaviors, and is likely to modulate these behaviors differently in males and females.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The comb-shaped pectines in scorpions are intriguing chemo- and mechanosensory organs. By using neuronal tracer and immunohistochemistry, we focused on the projection areas of mechanosensory pecten hair sensillae afferents in two species, <i>Mesobuthus eupeus</i> and <i>Euscorpius italicus</i>. We identified an extensive neuronal pathway, which includes distinct ventral neuropils, multisegmental ascending tracts, contralateral branches, and direct innervation of the third and fourth walking leg neuromeres. These results support the hypothesis that pecten hair sensillae function as sensors to elicit reflexive adjustment of body height and obstacle avoidance.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Scorpions’ sensory abilities are intriguing, especially the rather enigmatic ventral comb-like chemo- and mechanosensory organs, the so-called pectines. Attached ventrally to the second mesosomal segment just posterior to the coxae of the fourth walking leg pair, the pectines consist of the lamellae, the fulcra, and a variable number of pecten teeth. The latter contain the bimodal peg sensillae, used for probing the substrate with regard to chemo- and mechanosensory cues simultaneously. In addition, the lamellae, the fulcra and the pecten teeth are equipped with pecten hair sensillae (PHS) to gather mechanosensory information. Previously, we have analyzed the neuronal pathway associated with the peg sensillae unraveling their somatotopic projection pattern in dedicated pecten neuropils. Little is known, however, regarding the projections of PHS within the scorpion nervous system. Behavioral and electrophysiological assays showed involvement of PHS in reflexive responses but how the information is integrated remains unresolved. Here, we unravel the innervation pattern of the mechanosensory pecten hair afferents in <i>Mesobuthus eupeus</i> and <i>Euscorpius italicus</i>. By using immunofluorescent labeling and injection of Neurobiotin tracer, we identify extensive arborizations of afferents, including (i) ventral neuropils, (ii) somatotopically organized multisegmental sensory tracts, (iii) contralateral branches via commissures, and (iv) direct ipsilateral innervation of walking leg neuromeres 3 and 4. Our results suggest that PHS function as sensors to elicit reflexive adjustment of body height and obstacle avoidance, mediating accurate pecten teeth alignment to guarantee functionality of pectines, which are involved in fundamental capacities like mating or navigation.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The localization of neurons producing the gaseous transmitter nitric oxide are described throughout the brain and retina of the African cichlid <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>. Widespread <i>nnos</i> expression in the brain-, and sex- and status-specific differences in sensory tissues suggests diverse functional roles for nitrergic signaling in this social teleost fish.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase serves as an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that is involved in reproductive regulation, learning, sensory processing, and other forms of neural plasticity. Here, we map the distribution of <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells in the brain and retina of the cichlid fish <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> using in situ hybridization. In the brain, <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells are found from the olfactory bulbs to the hindbrain, including within specific nuclei involved in decision-making, sensory processing, neuroendocrine regulation, and the expression of social behaviors. In the retina, <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells are found in the inner nuclear layer, presumably in amacrine cells. We also used quantitative PCR to test for differences in <i>nnos</i> expression within the eye and olfactory bulbs of males and females of different reproductive states and social statuses. In the eye, males express more <i>nnos</i> than females, and socially dominant males express more <i>nnos</i> than subordinate males, but expression did not differ among female reproductive states. In the olfactory bulbs, dominant males had greater <i>nnos</i> expression than subordinate males. These results suggest a status-specific function for NO signaling in the visual and olfactory systems that may be important for sensory perception related to mating or territorial interactions to maintain the social hierarchy. The widespread distribution of <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells throughout the cichlid brain is similar to that in other teleosts, with some conserved localization patterns across vertebrates, suggesting diverse functions for this important neurotransmitter system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Uncoupling axon guidance and neuronal migration in Robo3‐deficient inferior olivary neurons</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Inferior olivary (IO) neurons are born in the dorsal hindbrain and migrate tangentially toward the ventral midline. During their dorsoventral migration, IO neurons extend long leading processes that cross the midline, transform into axons, and project into the contralateral cerebellum. In absence of the axon guidance receptor Robo3, IO axons fail to cross the midline and project to the ipsilateral cerebellum. Remarkably, the IO cell bodies still reach the midline where they form a nucleus of abnormal cytoarchitecture. The mechanisms underlying the migration of Robo3-deficient IO neurons are unknown. Here, we used three-dimensional imaging and transgenic mice to label subsets of IO neurons and study their migratory behavior in Robo3 knockout. We show that IO migration is delayed in absence of Robo3. Strikingly, Robo3-deficient IO neurons progress toward the midline in a direction opposite to their axons. This occurs through a change of polarity and the generation of a second leading process at the rear of the cell. These results suggest that Robo3 receptor controls the establishment of neuronal polarity and the coupling of axonogenesis and cell body migration in IO neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Drosophila Homolog of the Human Carpenter Syndrome Linked Gene, MEGF8, Is Required for Synapse Development and Function</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>Drosophila</I> multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 8 (dMegf8) is a homolog of human <I>MEGF8</I>. <I>MEGF8</I> encodes a multidomain transmembrane protein which is highly conserved across species. In humans, <I>MEGF8</I> mutations cause a rare genetic disorder called Carpenter syndrome, which is frequently associated with abnormal left-right patterning, cardiac defects, and learning disabilities. <I>MEGF8</I> is also associated with psychiatric disorders. Despite its clinical relevance, <I>MEGF8</I> remains poorly characterized; and although it is highly conserved, studies on animal models of Megf8 are also very limited. The presence of intellectual disabilities in Carpenter syndrome patients and association of <I>MEGF8</I> with psychiatric disorders indicate that mutations in <I>MEGF8</I> cause underlying defects in synaptic structure and functions. In this study, we investigated the role of <I>Drosophila</I> dMegf8 in glutamatergic synapses of the larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) in both males and females. We show that dMegf8 localizes to NMJ synapses and is required for proper synaptic growth. <I>dMegf8</I> mutant larvae and adults show severe motor coordination deficits. At the NMJ, <I>dMegf8</I> mutants show altered localization of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, defects in synaptic ultrastructure, and neurotransmission. Interestingly, <I>dMegf8</I> mutants have reduced levels of the Type II BMP receptor Wishful thinking (<I>Wit</I>). <I>dMegf8</I> displays genetic interactions with <I>neurexin-1</I> (<I>dnrx</I>) and <I>wit</I>, and in association with Dnrx and Wit plays an essential role in synapse organization. Our studies provide insights into human MEGF8 functions and potentially into mechanisms that may underlie intellectual disabilities observed in Carpenter syndrome as well as MEGF8-related synaptic structural and/or functional deficits in psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Carpenter syndrome, known for over a century now, is a genetic disorder linked to mutations in <I>Multiple Epidermal Growth Factor-like Domains 8</I> (<I>MEGF8</I>) gene and associated with intellectual disabilities among other symptoms. <I>MEGF8</I> is also associated with psychiatric disorders. Despite the high genetic conservation and clinical relevance, the functions of <I>MEGF8</I> remain largely uncharacterized. Patients with intellectual disabilities and psychiatric diseases often have an underlying defect in synaptic structure and function. This work defines the role of the fly homolog of human <I>MEGF8</I>, <I>dMegf8</I>, in glutamatergic synapse growth, organization, and function and provide insights into potential functions of <I>MEGF8</I> in human central synapses and synaptic mechanisms that may underlie psychiatric disorders and intellectual disabilities seen in Carpenter syndrome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Functional Cooperation of {alpha}-Synuclein and Tau Is Essential for Proper Corticogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alpha-synuclein (&alpha;Syn) and tau are abundant multifunctional neuronal proteins, and their intracellular deposits have been linked to many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Despite the disease relevance, their physiological roles remain elusive, as mice with knock-out of either of these genes do not exhibit overt phenotypes. To reveal functional cooperation, we generated &alpha;Syn<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>tau<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> double-knock-out mice and characterized the functional cross talk between these proteins during brain development. Intriguingly, deletion of &alpha;Syn and tau reduced Notch signaling and accelerated interkinetic nuclear migration of G2 phase at early embryonic stage. This significantly altered the balance between the proliferative and neurogenic divisions of progenitor cells, resulting in an overproduction of early born neurons and enhanced neurogenesis, by which the brain size was enlarged during the embryonic stage in both sexes. On the other hand, a reduction in the number of neural progenitor cells in the middle stage of corticogenesis diminished subsequent gliogenesis in the &alpha;Syn<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>tau<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> cortex. Additionally, the expansion and maturation of macroglial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) were suppressed in the &alpha;Syn<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>tau<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> postnatal brain, which in turn reduced the male &alpha;Syn<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>tau<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> brain size and cortical thickness to less than the control values. Our study identifies important functional cooperation of &alpha;Syn and tau during corticogenesis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Correct understanding of the physiological functions of &alpha;Syn and tau in CNS is critical to elucidate pathogenesis involved in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We show here that &alpha;Syn and tau are cooperatively involved in brain development via maintenance of progenitor cells. &alpha;Syn and tau double-knock-out mice exhibited an overproduction of early born neurons and accelerated neurogenesis at early corticogenesis. Furthermore, loss of &alpha;Syn and tau also perturbed gliogenesis at later embryonic stage, as well as the subsequent glial expansion and maturation at postnatal brain. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights and extend therapeutic opportunities for neurodegenerative diseases caused by aberrant &alpha;Syn and tau.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics and Mechanisms of Contrast-Dependent Modulation of Spatial-Frequency Tuning in the Early Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The spatial-frequency (SF) tuning of neurons in the early visual cortex is adjusted for stimulus contrast. As the contrast increases, SF tuning is modulated so that the transmission of fine features is facilitated. A variety of mechanisms are involved in shaping SF tunings, but those responsible for the contrast-dependent modulations are unclear. To address this, we measured the time course of SF tunings of area 17 neurons in male cats under different contrasts with a reverse correlation. After response onset, the optimal SF continuously shifted to a higher SF over time, with a larger shift for higher contrast. At high contrast, whereas neurons with a large shift of optimal SF exhibited a large bandwidth decrease, those with a negligible shift increased the bandwidth over time. Between these two extremes, the degree of SF shift and bandwidth change continuously varied. At low contrast, bandwidth generally decreased over time. These dynamic effects enhanced the processing of high-frequency range under a high-contrast condition and allowed time-average SF tuning curves to show contrast-dependent modulation, like that of steady-state SF tuning curves reported previously. Combinations of two mechanisms, one that decreases bandwidth and shifts optimal SF, and another that increases bandwidth without shifting optimal SF, would explain the full range of SF tuning dynamics. Our results indicate that one of the essential roles of tuning dynamics of area 17 neurons, which have been observed for various visual features, is to adjust tunings depending on contrast.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The spatial scales of features transmitted by cortical neurons are adjusted depending on stimulus contrast. However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. We measured the time course of spatial frequency tunings of cat area 17 neurons under different contrast conditions and observed a variety of dynamic effects that contributed to spatial-scale adjustment, allowing neurons to adjust their spatial frequency tuning range depending on contrast. Our results suggest that one of the essential roles of tuning dynamics of area 17 neurons, which have been observed for various visual features, is to adjust tunings depending on contrast.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Crossed Corticostriatal Projections in the Macaque Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>In nonhuman primates, major input to the striatum originates from ipsilateral cortex and thalamus. The striatum is a target also of crossed corticostriatal (CSt) projections from the contralateral hemisphere, which have been so far somewhat neglected. In the present study, based on neural tracer injections in different parts of the striatum in macaques of either sex, we analyzed and compared qualitatively and quantitatively the distribution of labeled CSt cells in the two hemispheres. The results showed that crossed CSt projections to the caudate and the putamen can be relatively robust (up to 30% of total labeled cells). The origin of the direct and the crossed CSt projections was not symmetrical as the crossed ones originated almost exclusively from motor, prefrontal, and cingulate areas and not from parietal and temporal areas. Furthermore, there were several cases in which the contribution of contralateral areas tended to equal that of the ipsilateral ones. The present study is the first detailed description of this anatomic pathway of the macaque brain and provides the substrate for bilateral distribution of motor, motivational, and cognitive signals for reinforcement learning and selection of actions or action sequences, and for learning compensatory motor strategies after cortical stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In nonhuman primates the striatum is a target of projections originating from the contralateral hemisphere (crossed CSt projections), which have been so far poorly investigated. The present study analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively in the macaque brain the origin of the crossed CSt projections compared with those originating from the ipsilateral hemisphere. The results showed that crossed CSt projections originate mostly from frontal and rostral cingulate areas and in some cases their contribution tended to equal that from ipsilateral areas. These projections could provide the substrate for bilateral distribution of motor, motivational, and cognitive signals for reinforcement learning and action selection, and for learning compensatory motor strategies after cortical stroke.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adult Born Dentate Granule Cell Mediated Upregulation of Feedback Inhibition in a Mouse Model of Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) and behavioral comorbidities frequently develop after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Aberrant neurogenesis of dentate granule cells (DGCs) after TBI may contribute to the synaptic reorganization that occurs in PTE, but how neurogenesis at different times relative to the injury contributes to feedback inhibition and recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus is unknown. Thus, we examined whether DGCs born at different postnatal ages differentially participate in feedback inhibition and recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI. Both sexes of transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) in postnatally born DGCs were used for optogenetic activation of three DGC cohorts: postnatally early born DGCs, or those born just before or after CCI. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from ChR2-negative, mature DGCs and parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PVBCs) in hippocampal slices to determine whether optogenetic activation of postnatally born DGCs increases feedback inhibition and/or recurrent excitation in mice 8-10 weeks after CCI and whether PVBCs are targets of ChR2-positive DGCs. In the dentate gyrus ipsilateral to CCI, activation of ChR2-expressing DGCs born before CCI produced increased feedback inhibition in ChR2-negative DGCs and increased excitation in PVBCs compared with those from sham controls. This upregulated feedback inhibition was less prominent in DGCs born early in life or after CCI. Surprisingly, ChR2-positive DGC activation rarely evoked recurrent excitation in mature DGCs from any cohort. These results support that DGC birth date-related increased feedback inhibition in of DGCs may contribute to altered excitability after TBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dentate granule cells (DGCs) control excitability of the dentate gyrus through synaptic interactions with inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. Persistent changes in DGC synaptic connectivity develop after traumatic brain injury, contributing to hyperexcitability in post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). However, the impact of DGC neurogenesis on synaptic reorganization, especially on inhibitory circuits, after brain injury is not adequately described. Here, upregulation of feedback inhibition in mature DGCs from male and female mice was associated with increased excitation of parvalbumin-expressing basket cells by postnatally born DGCs, providing novel insights into underlying mechanisms of altered excitability after brain injury. A better understanding of these inhibitory circuit changes can help formulate hypotheses for development of novel, evidence-based treatments for post-traumatic epilepsy by targeting birth date-specific subsets of DGCs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">{beta} Bursting in the Retrosplenial Cortex Is a Neurophysiological Correlate of Environmental Novelty Which Is Disrupted in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a significant role in spatial learning and memory and is functionally disrupted in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to investigate neurophysiological correlates of spatial learning and memory in this region we employed <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology in awake and freely moving male mice, comparing neural activity between wild-type and J20 mice, a transgenic model of AD-associated amyloidopathy. To determine the response of the RSC to environmental novelty local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded while mice explored novel and familiar recording arenas. In familiar environments we detected short, phasic bursts of &beta; (20&ndash;30 Hz) oscillations (&beta; bursts), which arose at a low but steady rate. Exposure to a novel environment rapidly initiated a dramatic increase in the rate, size and duration of &beta; bursts. Additionally, -&alpha;/&beta; cross-frequency coupling was significantly higher during novelty, and spiking of neurons in the RSC was significantly enhanced during &beta; bursts. Finally, excessive &beta; bursting was seen in J20 mice, including increased &beta; bursting during novelty and familiarity, yet a loss of coupling between &beta; bursts and spiking activity. These findings support the concept that &beta; bursting may be responsible for the activation and reactivation of neuronal ensembles underpinning the formation and maintenance of cortical representations, and that disruptions to this activity in J20 mice may underlie cognitive impairments seen in these animals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is thought to be involved in the formation, recall and consolidation of contextual memory. The discovery of bursts of &beta; oscillations in this region, which are associated with increased neuronal spiking and strongly upregulated while mice explore novel environments, provides a potential mechanism for the activation of neuronal ensembles, which may underlie the formation of cortical representations of context. Excessive &beta; bursting in the RSC of J20 mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), alongside the disassociation of &beta; bursting from neuronal spiking, may underlie spatial memory impairments previously shown in these mice. These findings introduce a novel neurophysiological correlate of spatial learning and memory, and a potentially new form of AD-related cortical dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Common Neural Mechanisms Control Attention and Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although previous studies point to qualitative similarities between working memory (WM) and attention, the degree to which these two constructs rely on shared neural mechanisms remains unknown. Focusing on one such potentially shared mechanism, we tested the hypothesis that selecting an item within WM utilizes similar neural mechanisms as selecting a visible item via a shift of attention. We used fMRI and machine learning to decode both the selection among items visually available and the selection among items stored in WM in human subjects (both sexes). Patterns of activity in visual, parietal, and to a lesser extent frontal cortex predicted the locations of the selected items. Critically, these patterns were strikingly interchangeable; classifiers trained on data during attentional selection predicted selection from WM, and classifiers trained on data during selection from memory predicted attentional selection. Using models of voxel receptive fields, we visualized topographic population activity that revealed gain enhancements at the locations of the externally and internally selected items. Our results suggest that selecting among perceived items and selecting among items in WM share a common mechanism. This common mechanism, analogous to a shift of spatial attention, controls the relative gains of neural populations that encode behaviorally relevant information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How we allocate our attention to external stimuli that we see and to internal representations of stimuli stored in memory might rely on a common mechanism. Supporting this hypothesis, we demonstrated that not only could patterns of human brain activity predict which items were selected during perception and memory, but that these patterns were interchangeable during external and internal selection. Additionally, this generalized selection mechanism operates by changes in the gains of the neural populations both encoding attended sensory representations and storing relevant memory representations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Distributed Network for Multimodal Experiential Representation of Concepts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and psychophysical evidence indicate that concept retrieval selectively engages specific sensory and motor brain systems involved in the acquisition of the retrieved concept. However, it remains unclear which supramodal cortical regions contribute to this process and what kind of information they represent. Here, we used representational similarity analysis of two large fMRI datasets with a searchlight approach to generate a detailed map of human brain regions where the semantic similarity structure across individual lexical concepts can be reliably detected. We hypothesized that heteromodal cortical areas typically associated with the default mode network encode multimodal experiential information about concepts, consistent with their proposed role as cortical integration hubs. In two studies involving different sets of concepts and different participants (both sexes), we found a distributed, bihemispheric network engaged in concept representation, composed of high-level association areas in the anterior, lateral, and ventral temporal lobe; inferior parietal lobule; posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus; and medial, dorsal, ventrolateral, and orbital prefrontal cortex. In both studies, a multimodal model combining sensory, motor, affective, and other types of experiential information explained significant variance in the neural similarity structure observed in these regions that was not explained by unimodal experiential models or by distributional semantics (i.e., word2vec similarity). These results indicate that during concept retrieval, lexical concepts are represented across a vast expanse of high-level cortical regions, especially in the areas that make up the default mode network, and that these regions encode multimodal experiential information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Conceptual knowledge includes information acquired through various modalities of experience, such as visual, auditory, tactile, and emotional information. We investigated which brain regions encode mental representations that combine information from multiple modalities when participants think about the meaning of a word. We found that such representations are encoded across a widely distributed network of cortical areas in both hemispheres, including temporal, parietal, limbic, and prefrontal association areas. Several areas not traditionally associated with semantic cognition were also implicated. Our results indicate that the retrieval of conceptual knowledge during word comprehension relies on a much larger portion of the cerebral cortex than previously thought and that multimodal experiential information is represented throughout the entire network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Causal Inference of Body Ownership in the Posterior Parietal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>How do we come to sense that a hand in view belongs to our own body or not? Previous studies have suggested that the integration of vision and somatosensation in the frontoparietal areas plays a critical role in the sense of body ownership (i.e., the multisensory perception of limbs and body parts as our own). However, little is known about how these areas implement the multisensory integration process at the computational level and whether activity predicts illusion elicitation in individual participants on a trial-by-trial basis. To address these questions, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a rubber hand illusion-detection task and fitted the registered neural responses to a Bayesian causal inference model of body ownership. Thirty healthy human participants (male and female) performed 12 s trials with varying degrees of asynchronously delivered visual and tactile stimuli of a rubber hand (in view) and a (hidden) real hand. After the 12 s period, participants had to judge whether the rubber hand felt like their own. As hypothesized, activity in the premotor and posterior parietal cortices was related to illusion elicitation at the level of individual participants and trials. Importantly, activity in the posterior parietal cortex fit the predicted probability of illusion emergence of the Bayesian causal inference model based on each participant's behavioral response profile. Our findings suggest an important role for the posterior parietal cortex in implementing Bayesian causal inference of body ownership and reveal how trial-by-trial variations in neural signatures of multisensory integration relate to the elicitation of the rubber hand illusion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the brain create a coherent perceptual experience of one's own body based on information from the different senses? We examined how the likelihood of eliciting a classical bodily illusion that depends on vision and touch&mdash;the rubber hand illusion&mdash;is related to neural activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that trial-by-trial variations in the neural signal in the posterior parietal cortex, a well known center for sensory integration, fitted a statistical function that describes how likely it is that the brain infers that a rubber hand is one's own given the available visual and tactile evidence. Thus, probabilistic analysis of sensory information in the parietal lobe underlies our unitary sense of bodily self.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stimulus-Induced Changes in 1/f-like Background Activity in EEG</a></h4>

              
                <p>Research into the nature of 1/<I>f</I>-like, nonoscillatory electrophysiological activity has grown exponentially in recent years in cognitive neuroscience. The shape of this activity has been linked to the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits, which is thought to be important for information processing. However, to date, it is not known whether the presentation of a stimulus induces changes in the parameters of 1/<I>f</I> activity in scalp recordings, separable from event-related potentials (ERPs). Here, we analyzed event-related broadband changes in human EEG both before and after removing ERPs to demonstrate their confounding effect, and to establish whether there are genuine stimulus-induced changes in 1/<I>f</I>. Using data from a passive and an active auditory task (<I>n</I> = 23, 61% female), we found that the shape of the post-event spectra between 2 and 25 Hz differed significantly from the pre-event spectra even after removing the frequency-content of ERPs. Further, a significant portion of this difference could be accounted for by a rotational shift in 1/<I>f</I> activity, manifesting as an increase in low and a decrease in high frequencies. Importantly, the magnitude of this rotational shift was related to the attentional demands of the task. This change in 1/<I>f</I> is consistent with increased inhibition following stimulus onset, and likely reflects a disruption of ongoing excitatory activity proportional to processing demands. Finally, these findings contradict the central assumption of baseline normalization strategies in time-frequency analyses, namely, that background EEG activity is stationary across time. As such, they have far-reaching consequences relevant for several subfields of neuroscience.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Interest in the functional role of the 1/<I>f</I>-like background brain activity has been growing exponentially in neuroscience. Yet, no study to date has demonstrated a clear relationship between information processing and 1/<I>f</I> activity by investigating event-related effects on its parameters in noninvasive recordings of neural activity. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that stimuli induce rotational changes in 1/<I>f</I> activity, detectable at lower frequencies and independent from the occurrence of event-related potentials. These findings suggest the presence of large-scale inhibition following stimulus onset, largest when the stimulus is novel, and indicate that the assumption of stationary background activity in the analysis of neural oscillations is untenable. These results have far-reaching consequences that cut across several subfields of neuroscience.</p>

                <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive and inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. Peroxisomes perform critical functions that contribute to CNS homeostasis. We investigated peroxisome injury and mitigating effects of peroxisome-restorative therapy on inflammatory demyelination in models of MS. Human autopsied CNS tissues (male and female), human cell cultures, and cuprizone-mediated demyelination mice (female) were examined by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunolabeling. The therapeutic peroxisome proliferator, 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) was investigated <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. White matter from MS patients showed reduced peroxisomal transcript and protein levels, including PMP70, compared with non-MS controls. Cultured human neural cells revealed that human microglia contained abundant peroxisomal proteins. TNF-&alpha;-exposed microglia displayed reduced immunolabeling of peroxisomal proteins, PMP70 and PEX11&beta;, which was prevented with 4-PBA. In human myeloid cells exposed to TNF-&alpha; or nigericin, suppression of PEX11&beta; and catalase protein levels were observed to be dependent on NLRP3 expression. Hindbrains from cuprizone-exposed mice showed reduced <I>Abcd1</I>, <I>Cat</I>, and <I>Pex5l</I> transcript levels, with concurrent increased <I>Nlrp3</I> and <I>Il1b</I> transcript levels, which was abrogated by 4-PBA. In the central corpus callosum, Iba-1 in CNS-associated macrophages and peroxisomal thiolase immunostaining after cuprizone exposure was increased by 4-PBA. 4-PBA prevented decreased myelin basic protein and neurofilament heavy chain immunoreactivity caused by cuprizone exposure. Cuprizone-induced neurobehavioral deficits were improved by 4-PBA treatment. Peroxisome injury in CNS-associated macrophages contributed to neuroinflammation and demyelination that was prevented by 4-PBA treatment. A peroxisome-targeted therapy might be valuable for treating inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration in MS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common and disabling disorder of the CNS with no curative therapies for its progressive form. The present studies implicate peroxisome impairment in CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs), which include resident microglia and blood-derived macrophages, as an important contributor to inflammatory demyelination and neuroaxonal injury in MS. We also show that the inflammasome molecule NLRP3 is associated with peroxisome injury <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>, especially in CAMs. Treatment with the peroxisome proliferator 4-phenylbutyrate exerted protective effects with improved molecular, morphologic, and neurobehavioral outcomes that were associated with a neuroprotective CAM phenotype. These findings offer novel insights into the contribution of peroxisome injury in MS together with preclinical testing of a rational therapy for MS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Shared and Distinct Functional Effects of Patient-Specific Tbr1 Mutations on Cortical Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>T-Box Brain Transcription Factor 1 (TBR1) plays essential roles in brain development, mediating neuronal migration, fate specification, and axon tract formation. While heterozygous loss-of-function and missense <I>TBR1</I> mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, the effects of these heterogeneous mutations on brain development have yet to be fully explored. We characterized multiple mouse lines carrying <I>Tbr1</I> mutations differing by type and exonic location, including the previously generated <I>Tbr1</I> exon 2-3 knock-out (KO) line, and we analyzed male and female mice at neonatal and adult stages. The frameshift patient mutation A136PfsX80 (A136fs) caused reduced TBR1 protein in cortex similar to <I>Tbr1</I> KO, while the missense patient mutation K228E caused significant TBR1 upregulation. Analysis of cortical layer formation found similar defects between KO and A136fs homozygotes in their CUX1<sup>+</sup> and CTIP2<sup>+</sup> layer positions, while K228E homozygosity produced layering defects distinct from these mutants. Meanwhile, the examination of cortical apoptosis found extensive cell death in KO homozygotes but limited cell death in A136fs or K228E homozygotes. Despite their discordant cortical phenotypes, these <I>Tbr1</I> mutations produced several congruent phenotypes, including anterior commissure reduction in heterozygotes, which was previously observed in humans with <I>TBR1</I> mutations. These results indicate that patient-specific <I>Tbr1</I> mutant mice will be valuable translational models for pinpointing shared and distinct etiologies among patients with <I>TBR1</I>-related developmental conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mutations of the <I>TBR1</I> gene increase the likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions such as intellectual disability and autism. Therefore, the study of <I>TBR1</I> can offer insights into the biological mechanisms underlying these conditions, which affect millions worldwide. To improve the modeling of <I>TBR1</I>-related conditions over current <I>Tbr1</I> knock-out mice, we created mouse lines carrying <I>Tbr1</I> mutations identical to those found in human patients. Mice with one mutant <I>Tbr1</I> copy show reduced amygdalar connections regardless of mutation type, suggesting a core biomarker for <I>TBR1</I>-related disorders. In mice with two mutant <I>Tbr1</I> copies, brain phenotypes diverge by mutation type, suggesting differences in <I>Tbr1</I> gene functionality in different patients. These mouse models will serve as valuable tools for understanding genotype&ndash;phenotype relationships among patients with neurodevelopmental conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Fast Event-Related Mapping of Population Fingertip Tuning Properties in Human Sensorimotor Cortex at 7T</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>fMRI studies that investigate somatotopic tactile representations in the human cortex typically use either block or phase-encoded stimulation designs. Event-related (ER) designs allow for more flexible and unpredictable stimulation sequences than the other methods, but they are less efficient. Here, we compared an efficiency-optimized fast ER design (2.8-s average intertrial interval; ITI) to a conventional slow ER design (8-s average ITI) for mapping voxelwise fingertip tactile tuning properties in the sensorimotor cortex of six participants at 7 Tesla. The fast ER design yielded more reliable responses compared with the slow ER design, but with otherwise similar tuning properties. Concatenating the fast and slow ER data, we demonstrate in each individual brain the existence of two separate somatotopically-organized tactile representations of the fingertips, one in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) on the postcentral gyrus, and the other shared across the motor and premotor cortices on the precentral gyrus. In both S1 and motor representations, fingertip selectivity decreased progressively, from narrowly-tuned Brodmann area (BA) 3b and BA4a, respectively, toward associative parietal and frontal regions that responded equally to all fingertips, suggesting increasing information integration along these two pathways. In addition, fingertip selectivity in S1 decreased from the cortical representation of the thumb to that of the pinky.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Molecular Markers of Mechanosensation in Glycinergic Neurons in the Avian Lumbosacral Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                <p>Birds are exceptionally adept at controlling their body position. For example, they can coordinate rapid movements of their body while stabilizing their head. Intriguingly, this ability may rely in part on a mechanosensory organ in the avian lower spinal cord called the lumbosacral organ (LSO). However, molecular mechanotransduction mechanisms have not been identified in the avian spinal cord. Here, we report the presence of glycinergic neurons in the LSO that exhibit immunoreactivity for myosin7a and espin, molecules essential for function and maintenance of hair cells in the inner ear. Specifically, we find glycinergic cell bodies near the central canal and processes that extend laterally to the accessory lobes and spinal ligaments. These LSO neurons are reminiscent of glycinergic neurons in a recently-described lateral spinal proprioceptive organ in zebrafish that detects spinal bending. The avian LSO, however, is located inside a series of fused vertebrae called the synsacrum, which constrains spinal bending. We suggest the LSO may be a modification and elaboration of a preexisting mechanosensory spinal network in vertebrates. A mechanistic understanding of its function may be an important clue to understanding the evolution and development of avian locomotion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Noninvasive fungal rhinosinusitis: a case series [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Fungal rhinosinusitis (FRS) remains a rare disease. The noninvasive forms are hard to diagnose. The management protocols remain controversial. We aim to describe the clinical, radiological and pathological features of noninvasive FRS and present our management protocol and follow-up results. Patients and methods: This descriptive study was conducted in the ear-nose-throat department of the university hospital, Taher Sfar in Mahdia, Tunisia. All patients who responded to the definition of noninvasive FRS (fungal balls and allergic fungal sinusitis) were included. The study was conducted over a three year period (May 2017 – April 2021). Results: Eleven patients were included in this study: four cases of fungal balls and seven cases of allergic fungal sinusitis. Patients presented with symptoms of chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis with no response to conventional treatments. Computed tomodensitometry scan showed opacification of the paranasal sinuses in all patients. Other signs were heterogeneous opacities, local calcifications and thinning of the bony walls of the sinuses. Histopathological findings were inflammatory polyps in all cases of allergic FRS with the presence of fungal hyphae in 42.8% of the cases. All patients underwent surgery after a median delay of 12 [6–24] months of the symptom’s onset. The used procedures were endoscopic middle meatal antrostomy for all patients, ethmoidectomy (81.8%) and sphenoidotomy (36.4%). None received systemic antifungals or corticosteroids with a favorable outcome in all cases. Conclusion: Symptoms of noninvasive FRS are nonspecific. The scan images contribute to the diagnosis, but the perioperative findings and the histopathological results remain crucial.  The management is mainly surgical.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Testing microbiome associations with survival times at both the community and individual taxon levels</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yingtian Hu, Yunxiao Li, Glen A. Satten, Yi-Juan Hu</p>
Background <p>Finding microbiome associations with possibly censored survival times is an important problem, especially as specific taxa could serve as biomarkers for disease prognosis or as targets for therapeutic interventions. The two existing methods for survival outcomes, MiRKAT-S and OMiSA, are restricted to testing associations at the community level and do not provide results at the individual taxon level. An ad hoc approach testing each taxon with a survival outcome using the Cox proportional hazard model may not perform well in the microbiome setting with sparse count data and small sample sizes.</p> Methods <p>We have previously developed the linear decomposition model (LDM) for testing continuous or discrete outcomes that unifies community-level and taxon-level tests into one framework. Here we extend the LDM to test survival outcomes. We propose to use the Martingale residuals or the deviance residuals obtained from the Cox model as continuous covariates in the LDM. We further construct tests that combine the results of analyzing each set of residuals separately. Finally, we extend PERMANOVA, the most commonly used distance-based method for testing community-level hypotheses, to handle survival outcomes in a similar manner.</p> Results <p>Using simulated data, we showed that the LDM-based tests preserved the false discovery rate for testing individual taxa and had good sensitivity. The LDM-based community-level tests and PERMANOVA-based tests had comparable or better power than MiRKAT-S and OMiSA. An analysis of data on the association of the gut microbiome and the time to acute graft-versus-host disease revealed several dozen associated taxa that would not have been achievable by any community-level test, as well as improved community-level tests by the LDM and PERMANOVA over those obtained using MiRKAT-S and OMiSA.</p> Conclusions <p>Unlike existing methods, our new methods are capable of discovering individual taxa that are associated with survival times, which could be of important use in clinical settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Distinguishing shadows from surface boundaries using local achromatic cues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher DiMattina, Josiah J. Burnham, Betul N. Guner, Haley B. Yerxa</p>

In order to accurately parse the visual scene into distinct surfaces, it is essential to determine whether a local luminance edge is caused by a boundary between two surfaces or a shadow cast across a single surface. Previous studies have demonstrated that local chromatic cues may help to distinguish edges caused by shadows from those caused by surface boundaries, but the information potentially available in local <i>achromatic</i> cues like contrast, texture, and penumbral blur remains poorly understood. In this study, we develop and analyze a large database of hand-labeled achromatic shadow edges to better understand what image properties distinguish them from occlusion edges. We find that both the highest contrast as well as the lowest contrast edges are more likely to be occlusions than shadows, extending previous observations based on a more limited image set. We also find that contrast cues alone can reliably distinguish the two edge categories with nearly 70% accuracy at 40x40 resolution. Logistic regression on a Gabor Filter bank (GFB) modeling a population of V1 simple cells separates the categories with nearly 80% accuracy, and furthermore exhibits tuning to penumbral blur. A Filter-Rectify Filter (FRF) style neural network extending the GFB model performed at better than 80% accuracy, and exhibited blur tuning and greater sensitivity to texture differences. We compare human performance on our edge classification task to that of the FRF and GFB models, finding the best human observers attaining the same performance as the machine classifiers. Several analyses demonstrate both classifiers exhibit significant positive correlation with human behavior, although we find a slightly better agreement on an image-by-image basis between human performance and the FRF model than the GFB model, suggesting an important role for texture.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A normative model of peripersonal space encoding as performing impact prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zdenek Straka, Jean-Paul Noel, Matej Hoffmann</p>

Accurately predicting contact between our bodies and environmental objects is paramount to our evolutionary survival. It has been hypothesized that multisensory neurons responding both to touch on the body, and to auditory or visual stimuli occurring near them—thus delineating our peripersonal space (PPS)—may be a critical player in this computation. However, we lack a normative account (i.e., a model specifying how we <i>ought to</i> compute) linking impact prediction and PPS encoding. Here, we leverage Bayesian Decision Theory to develop such a model and show that it recapitulates many of the characteristics of PPS. Namely, a normative model of impact prediction (i) delineates a graded boundary between near and far space, (ii) demonstrates an enlargement of PPS as the speed of incoming stimuli increases, (iii) shows stronger contact prediction for looming than receding stimuli—but critically is still present for receding stimuli when observation uncertainty is non-zero—, (iv) scales with the value we attribute to environmental objects, and finally (v) can account for the differing sizes of PPS for different body parts. Together, these modeling results support the conjecture that PPS reflects the computation of impact prediction, and make a number of testable predictions for future empirical studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A prosthesis utilizing natural vestibular encoding strategies improves sensorimotor performance in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kantapon Pum Wiboonsaksakul, Dale C. Roberts, Charles C. Della Santina, Kathleen E. Cullen</p>

Sensory pathways provide complex and multifaceted information to the brain. Recent advances have created new opportunities for applying our understanding of the brain to sensory prothesis development. Yet complex sensor physiology, limited numbers of electrodes, and nonspecific stimulation have proven to be a challenge for many sensory systems. In contrast, the vestibular system is uniquely suited for prosthesis development. Its peripheral anatomy allows site-specific stimulation of 3 separate sensory organs that encode distinct directions of head motion. Accordingly, here, we investigated whether implementing natural encoding strategies improves vestibular prosthesis performance. The eye movements produced by the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which plays an essential role in maintaining visual stability, were measured to quantify performance. Overall, implementing the natural tuning dynamics of vestibular afferents produced more temporally accurate VOR eye movements. Exploration of the parameter space further revealed that more dynamic tunings were not beneficial due to saturation and unnatural phase advances. Trends were comparable for stimulation encoding virtual versus physical head rotations, with gains enhanced in the latter case. Finally, using computational methods, we found that the same simple model explained the eye movements evoked by sinusoidal and transient stimulation and that a stimulation efficacy substantially less than 100% could account for our results. Taken together, our results establish that prosthesis encodings that incorporate naturalistic afferent dynamics and account for activation efficacy are well suited for restoration of gaze stability. More generally, these results emphasize the benefits of leveraging the brain’s endogenous coding strategies in prosthesis development to improve functional outcomes.

Writing in PLOS Biology, Ching and colleagues show that ACE2-decorated exosomes are deployed as natural inhibitory decoys against SARS-CoV-2. High decoy levels correlate with improved patient outcomes, suggesting they directly help COVID-19 recovery and supporting the concept of successful future decoy-based therapies.

Here, Fernbach and Hale comment on a new PLOS Biology article that describes how receptor-decorated decoys are an effective feature of the body’s own innate immune arsenal of antiviral weapons against SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Ghost lineages can invalidate or even reverse findings regarding gene flow</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Théo Tricou, Eric Tannier, Damien M. de Vienne</p>

Introgression, endosymbiosis, and gene transfer, i.e., horizontal gene flow (HGF), are primordial sources of innovation in all domains of life. Our knowledge on HGF relies on detection methods that exploit some of its signatures left on extant genomes. One of them is the effect of HGF on branch lengths of constructed phylogenies. This signature has been formalized in statistical tests for HGF detection and used for example to detect massive adaptive gene flows in malaria vectors or to order evolutionary events involved in eukaryogenesis. However, these studies rely on the assumption that ghost lineages (all unsampled extant and extinct taxa) have little influence. We demonstrate here with simulations and data reanalysis that when considering the more realistic condition that unsampled taxa are legion compared to sampled ones, the conclusion of these studies become unfounded or even reversed. This illustrates the necessity to recognize the existence of ghosts in evolutionary studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Combating COVID-19 in Ghana using socio-pedagogical methods: educational campaign through children’s arts [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This brief report presents an action research project that was conducted in 2020 to contribute to approaches to ensure adherence to COVID-19 health protocols by children in Ghana. The research was on the basis that when adults allow children to share the burden of finding effective measures to the adherence of COVID-19 health protocols, the spread of the virus will be contained, which would also ensure the safety of children. Method: The action research was designed to be socially engaging, therefore a qualitative approach using Arts-Based-Research was adopted. Arts, as a socio-pedagogical method, was used as a tool to engage 189 children, between the ages of 4 and 15 years, in art workshops in Kumasi, Ghana’s second-largest city. The children, from different socioeconomic backgrounds, were aided by Art Assistants to handle the different art materials. Results: The different artistic depiction of children on COVID-19 suggests that the awareness created had reached many children irrespective of their socioeconomic background. However, how it was portrayed by the child participants introduced a fun aspect enabling the art materials to be used for advocacy. Conclusion: The medium, children’s art, used was innovative and caught the attention of children and adults alike, hence the art materials were effective advocacy materials. Also, the flexibility of the project design enabled the researchers to adapt the outputs to suit the rapidly evolving COVID-19 issues in the country to make the project more effective.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors Associated with National Health Insurance Coverage in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The National Health Insurance (NHI) program is the Indonesian government's national health program. However, health insurance coverage has not been maximized. This study aims to analyze the factors associated with health insurance coverage in Indonesia.   Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional data were obtained from the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey 2017. A total of 39,580 respondents were selected using two-stage stratified cluster sampling. The data come from the DHS Questionnaire Phase 7. In this study, we explored age, education level, wealth quintiles, residence, the number of children who are alive, marital status, current employment status, earnings, and health insurance status in relation to health insurance coverage. Then, we analyzed the data using chi-squared and binary logistic analyses.   Results: The prevalence of health insurance coverage in the Indonesian population is 62.3%. Respondent aged 15-24 years [AOR=0.88; 95% CI=0.77-1.00], secondary education level [AOR=0.44; 95% CI=0.41-0.47], poorer wealth index [AOR=0.76; 95% CI=0.71-0.82], live in rural area [AOR=0.78; 95% CI=0.75-0.82], divorced [AOR=0.72; 95% CI=0.63-0.83] were less likelihood to have health insurance. Conversely, the respondent who received earnings [AOR=1.25; 95% CI=1.18-1.32] was more likely to have health insurance.  Conclusion: This finding pointed to education level, economic status, and demographic area such as respondents who lived in rural areas should more pay attention to NHI. Intervention through the provision of appropriate information about NHI should be promoted.

    Three-dimensional collective epithelial rotation around a given axis represents a coordinated cellular movement driving tissue morphogenesis and transformation. Questions regarding these behaviors and their relationship with substrate curvatures are intimately linked to spontaneous active matter processes and to vital morphogenetic and embryonic processes. Here, using interdisciplinary approaches, we study the dynamics of epithelial layers lining different cylindrical surfaces. We observe large-scale, persistent, and circumferential rotation in both concavely and convexly curved cylindrical tissues. While epithelia of inverse curvature show an orthogonal switch in actomyosin network orientation and opposite apicobasal polarities, their rotational movements emerge and vary similarly within a common curvature window. We further reveal that this persisting rotation requires stable cell-cell adhesion and Rac-1–dependent cell polarity. Using an active polar gel model, we unveil the different relationships of collective cell polarity and actin alignment with curvatures, which lead to coordinated rotational behavior despite the inverted curvature and cytoskeleton order.

    The in situ diagnosis of cardiac activities with simultaneous therapeutic electrical stimulation of the heart is key to preventing cardiac arrhythmia. Here, we present an unconventional single-device platform that enables in situ monitoring even in a wet condition and control of beating heart motions without interferences to the recording signal. This platform consists of the active-matrix array of pressure-sensitive transistors for detecting cardiac beatings, biocompatible, low-impedance electrodes for cardiac stimulations, and an alginate-based hydrogel adhesive for attaching this platform conformally to the epicardium. In contrast to conventional electrophysiological sensing using electrodes, the pressure-sensitive transistors measured mechanophysiological characteristics by monitoring the spatiotemporal distributions of cardiac pressures during heart beating motions. In vivo tests show mechanophysiological readings having good correlation with electrocardiography and negligible interference with the electrical artifacts caused during cardiac stimulations. This platform can therapeutically synchronize the rhythm of abnormal heartbeats through efficient pacing of cardiac arrhythmia.

    Phenotypic evolution is usually attributed to changes in protein function or gene transcription. In principle, mutations that affect protein abundance through enhancing or attenuating protein translation also could be an important source for phenotypic evolution. However, these types of mutations remain largely unexplored in the studies of phenotypic variation in nature. Through fine-scale genetic mapping and functional interrogation, we identify a single nucleotide substitution in an anthocyanin-activating
    <i>
     R2R3-MYB
    </i>
    gene causing flower color variation between a pair of closely related monkeyflower (
    <i>
     Mimulus
    </i>
    ) species, the hummingbird-pollinated
    <i>
     Mimulus cardinalis
    </i>
    , and self-pollinated
    <i>
     Mimulus parishii
    </i>
    . This causal mutation is located in the 5′ untranslated region and generates an upstream ATG start codon, leading to attenuated protein translation and reduced flower coloration in the self-pollinated species. Together, our results provide empirical support for the role of mutations affecting protein translation, as opposed to protein function or transcript level, in natural phenotypic variation.

    The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell growth and catabolism in response to nutrients through phosphorylation of key substrates. The tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) is a RagC/D guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–activating protein (GAP) that regulates mTORC1 phosphorylation of MiT-TFE transcription factors, controlling lysosome biogenesis and autophagy. We determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the active FLCN complex (AFC) containing FLCN, FNIP2, the N-terminal tail of SLC38A9, the RagA

Disruption of the AFC-specific interfaces of FLCN and FNIP2 with RagC eliminated GAP activity and led to nuclear retention of TFE3, with no effect on mTORC1 substrates S6K or 4E-BP1. The structure provides a basis for regulation of an mTORC1 substrate-specific pathway and a roadmap to discover MiT-TFE family selective mTORC1 antagonists.

    Alkynes represent a family of pivotal and sustainable feedstocks for various industries such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials, and they are widely used as important starting materials for the production of a broad range of chemical entities. Nevertheless, efficient structural elaborations of alkynes in chemical synthesis, especially asymmetric multifunctionalization of alkynes, remain largely unexplored. It is thus imperative to develop new asymmetric synthetic approaches, making use of these richly available chemical feedstocks, and enabling their conversion to value-added chiral molecules. Here, we disclose our findings on highly enantioselective multifunctionalization of alkynes by merging photochemistry and chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Our reported one-pot synthetic protocol is applicable to all types of alkyne substrates, incorporating all three reactants in a fully atom-economic fashion to produce optically enriched tetrasubstituted triaryl- and diarylmethanes, important structural scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and biological sciences.

    The sculpting of germ layers during gastrulation relies on the coordinated migration of progenitor cells, yet the cues controlling these long-range directed movements remain largely unknown. While directional migration often relies on a chemokine gradient generated from a localized source, we find that zebrafish ventrolateral mesoderm is guided by a self-generated gradient of the initially uniformly expressed and secreted protein Toddler/ELABELA/Apela. We show that the Apelin receptor, which is specifically expressed in mesodermal cells, has a dual role during gastrulation, acting as a scavenger receptor to generate a Toddler gradient, and as a chemokine receptor to sense this guidance cue. Thus, we uncover a single receptor–based self-generated gradient as the enigmatic guidance cue that can robustly steer the directional migration of mesoderm through the complex and continuously changing environment of the gastrulating embryo.

    The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies and is a component of almost all current vaccines. Here, RBD immunogens were created with stabilizing amino acid changes that improve the neutralizing antibody response, as well as characteristics for production, storage, and distribution. A computational design and in vitro screening platform identified three improved immunogens, each with approximately nine amino acid changes relative to the native RBD sequence, and four key changes conserved between immunogens. The changes are adaptable to all vaccine platforms and compatible with mutations in emerging variants of concern. The immunogens elicit higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than native RBD, focus the immune response to structured neutralizing epitopes, and have increased production yields and thermostability. Incorporating these variant-independent amino acid changes in next-generation COVID vaccines may enhance the neutralizing antibody response and lead to longer duration and broader protection.

    The use of postsynaptic current to drive long-lasting luminescence holds a disruptive potential for harnessing the next-generation of smart displays. Multiresponsive long afterglow emission can be achieved by integrating light-emitting polymers in electric spiked transistors trigged by distinct presynaptic signals inputs. Here, we report a highly effective electric spiked long afterglow organic light-emitting transistor (LAOLET), whose operation relies on a nanofloating gate architecture. Long afterglow emission with reconfigurable brightness and retention time is observed upon applying specific positive gate voltage spiked. Conversely, when negative gate voltage stimulus is applied, these LAOLETs function as click-on display. Interestingly, upon endowing the device with force sensing capabilities, it can operate as a long afterglow pressure sensor that emits long-lasting green light subsequently to a controlled extrusion action.

    The interface between magnetic material and superconductors has long been predicted to host unconventional superconductivity, such as spin-triplet pairing and topological nontrivial pairing state, particularly when spin-orbital coupling (SOC) is incorporated. To identify these unconventional pairing states, fabricating homogenous heterostructures that contain such various properties are preferred but often challenging. Here, we synthesized a trilayer-type van der Waals heterostructure of MnTe/Bi

    /Fe(Te, Se), which combined s-wave superconductivity, thickness-dependent magnetism, and strong SOC. Via low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed robust zero-energy states with notably nontrivial properties and an enhanced superconducting gap size on single unit cell (UC) MnTe surface. In contrast, no zero-energy state was observed on 2-UC MnTe. First-principle calculations further suggest that the 1-UC MnTe has large interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a frustrated AFM state, which could promote noncolinear spin textures. It thus provides a promising platform for exploring topological nontrivial superconductivity.

    DNA double-strand breaks occur in many acute and long-term neurological conditions, including neurodegeneration, neurotrauma, and stroke. Nonrepaired breaks chronically activate the DNA damage response in neurons, leading to neural dysfunction and apoptosis. Here, we show that targeting of the central ATM-Chk2 pathway regulating the response to double-strand breaks slows neural decline in
    <i>

    models of chronic neurodegeneration. Inhibitors of ATM-Chk2, but not the parallel ATR-Chk1 pathway, also promote marked, functional recovery after acute central nervous system injury in rats, suggesting that inhibiting nonhomologous end-joining rather than homologous recombination is crucial for neuroprotection. We demonstrate that the Chk2 inhibitor, prexasertib, which has been evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials for cancer, has potent neuroprotective effects and represents a new treatment option to promote functional recovery after spinal cord or optic nerve injury.

    In the field of femtomagnetism, magnetic matter is controlled by ultrafast laser pulses; here, we show that coupling phonon excitations of the nuclei to spin and charge leads to femto-phono-magnetism, a powerful route to control magnetic order at ultrafast times. With state-of-the-art theoretical simulations of coupled spin, charge, and lattice dynamics, we identify strong nonadiabatic spin-phonon coupled modes that dominate early time spin dynamics. Activating these phonon modes that we show leads to an additional (up to 40% extra) loss of moment in iron-platinum occurring within 40 femtoseconds of the pump laser pulse. Underpinning this enhanced ultrafast loss of spin moment, we identify a physical mechanism in which minority spin current drives an enhanced intersite minority charge transfer, in turn promoting increased on-site spin flips. Our finding demonstrates that the nuclear system, often assumed to play the role of an energy and angular momentum sink, when selectively preexcited, can play a profound role in controlling femtosecond spin dynamics in materials.

    CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has emerged as a powerful therapeutic technology, but the lack of safe and efficient in vivo delivery systems, especially for tissue-specific vectors, limits its broad clinical applications.

    Recent studies reported that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) could inhibit and enhance the phase separation in prion-like proteins. The molecular mechanism underlying such a puzzling phenomenon remains elusive. Here, taking the fused in sarcoma (FUS) solution as an example, we comprehensively reveal the underlying mechanism by which ATP regulates phase separation by combining the semiempirical quantum mechanical method, mean-field theory, and molecular simulation. At the microscopic level, ATP acts as a bivalent or trivalent binder; at the macroscopic level, the reentrant phase separation occurs in dilute FUS solutions, resulting from the ATP concentration–dependent binding ability under different conditions. The ATP concentration for dissolving the protein condensates is about 10 mM, agreeing with experimental results. Furthermore, from a dynamic point of view, the effect of ATP on phase separation is also nonmonotonic. This work provides a clear physical description of the microscopic interaction and macroscopic phase diagram of the ATP-modulated phase separation.

    Long-phase (interannual) tidal cycles have been shown to influence coastal flooding and sedimentation, but their role in shaping the extent and condition of tidal wetlands has received little attention. Here, we show that the 18.61-year lunar nodal cycle, popularly termed the “lunar wobble,” is a dominant control over the expansion and contraction of mangrove canopy cover over much of the Australian continent. Furthermore, the contrasting phasing of the 18.61-year lunar nodal cycle between diurnal and semidiurnal tidal settings has mediated the severity of drought impacts in northern bioregions. Long-phase tidal cycles regulate maximum tide heights, are an important control over mangrove canopy cover, and may influence mangrove ecosystem services including forest productivity and carbon sequestration at regional scales.

    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 in most cases, but some patients develop an excessive inflammatory process that can be fatal. As the NLRP3 inflammasome and additional inflammasomes are implicated in disease aggravation, drug repositioning to target inflammasomes emerges as a strategy to treat COVID-19. Here, we performed a high-throughput screening using a 2560 small-molecule compound library and identified FDA-approved drugs that function as pan-inflammasome inhibitors. Our best hit, niclosamide (NIC), effectively inhibits both inflammasome activation and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Mechanistically, induction of autophagy by NIC partially accounts for inhibition of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, but NIC-mediated inhibition of NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome are autophagy independent. NIC potently inhibited inflammasome activation in human monocytes infected in vitro, in PBMCs from patients with COVID-19, and in vivo in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study provides relevant information regarding the immunomodulatory functions of this promising drug for COVID-19 treatment.

    Development, morphogenesis, immune system function, and cancer metastasis rely on the ability of cells to move through diverse tissues. To dissect migratory cell behavior in vivo, we developed cell type–specific imaging and perturbation techniques for

    primordial germ cells (PGCs). We find that PGCs use global, retrograde cortical actin flows for orientation and propulsion during guided developmental homing. PGCs use RhoGEF2, a RhoA-specific RGS-RhoGEF, as a dose-dependent regulator of cortical flow through a feedback loop requiring its conserved PDZ and PH domains for membrane anchoring and local RhoA activation. This feedback loop is regulated for directional migration by RhoGEF2 availability and requires AMPK rather than canonical Gα

    signaling. AMPK multisite phosphorylation of RhoGEF2 near a conserved EB1 microtubule-binding SxIP motif releases RhoGEF2 from microtubule-dependent inhibition. Thus, we establish the mechanism by which global cortical flow and polarized RhoA activation can be dynamically adapted during natural cell navigation in a changing environment.

    Primates of modern aspect (euprimates) are characterized by a suite of characteristics (e.g., convergent orbits, grasping hands and feet, reduced claws, and leaping), but the selective pressures responsible for the evolution of these euprimate characteristics have long remained controversial. Here, we used a molecular phyloecological approach to determine the diet of the common ancestor of living primates (CALP), and the results showed that the CALP had increased carnivory. Given the carnivory of the CALP, along with the general observation that orbital convergence is largely restricted to ambush predators, our study suggests that the euprimate characteristics could have been more specifically adapted for ambush predation. In particular, our behavior experiment further shows that nonclaw climbing can significantly reduce noises, which could benefit the ancestral euprimates’ stalking to ambush their prey in trees. Therefore, our study suggests that the distinctive euprimate characteristics may have evolved as their specialized adaptation for ambush predation in arboreal environments.

   <div>
    IFNα is a key regulator of the dialogue between pancreatic β cells and the immune system in early type 1 diabetes (T1D). IFNα up-regulates HLA class I expression in human β cells, fostering autoantigen presentation to the immune system. We observed by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing that exposure of human induced pluripotent-derived islet-like cells to IFNα induces expression of HLA class I and of other genes involved in antigen presentation, including the transcriptional activator NLRC5. We next evaluated the global role of NLRC5 in human insulin-producing EndoC-βH1 and human islet cells by RNA sequencing and targeted gene/protein determination. NLRC5 regulates expression of HLA class I, antigen presentation–related genes, and chemokines. NLRC5 also mediates the effects of IFNα on alternative splicing, a generator of β cell neoantigens, suggesting that it is a central player of the effects of IFNα on β cells that contribute to trigger and amplify autoimmunity in T1D.

    The magnitude and distribution of net primary production (NPP) in the coastal ocean remains poorly constrained, particularly for shallow marine vegetation. Here, using a compilation of in situ annual NPP measurements across &gt;400 sites in 72 geographic ecoregions, we provide global predictions of the productivity of seaweed habitats, which form the largest vegetated coastal biome on the planet. We find that seaweed NPP is strongly coupled to climatic variables, peaks at temperate latitudes, and is dominated by forests of large brown seaweeds. Seaweed forests exhibit exceptionally high per-area production rates (a global average of 656 and 1711 gC m

    in the subtidal and intertidal, respectively), being up to 10 times higher than coastal phytoplankton in temperate and polar seas. Our results show that seaweed NPP is a strong driver of production in the coastal ocean and call for its integration in the oceanic carbon cycle, where it has traditionally been overlooked.

    The mechanism of action of eprenetapopt (APR-246, PRIMA-1
    <sup>
     MET
    </sup>
    ) as an anticancer agent remains unresolved, although the clinical development of eprenetapopt focuses on its reported mechanism of action as a mutant-p53 reactivator. Using unbiased approaches, this study demonstrates that eprenetapopt depletes cellular antioxidant glutathione levels by increasing its turnover, triggering a nonapoptotic, iron-dependent form of cell death known as ferroptosis. Deficiency in genes responsible for supplying cancer cells with the substrates for de novo glutathione synthesis (
    <i>
     SLC7A11
    </i>
    ,
    <i>
     SHMT2
    </i>
    , and
    <i>
     MTHFD1L
    </i>
    ), as well as the enzymes required to synthesize glutathione (
    <i>
     GCLC
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     GCLM
    </i>
    ), augments the activity of eprenetapopt. Eprenetapopt also inhibits iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis by limiting the cysteine desulfurase activity of NFS1, which potentiates ferroptosis and may restrict cellular proliferation. The combination of eprenetapopt with dietary serine and glycine restriction synergizes to inhibit esophageal xenograft tumor growth. These findings reframe the canonical view of eprenetapopt from a mutant-p53 reactivator to a ferroptosis inducer.

    The nighttime environment of much of Earth is being changed rapidly by the introduction of artificial lighting. While data on spatial and temporal variation in the intensity of artificial lighting have been available at a regional and global scale, data on variation in its spectral composition have only been collected for a few locations, preventing variation in associated environmental and human health risks from being mapped. Here, we use imagery obtained using digital cameras by astronauts on the International Space Station to map variation in the spectral composition of lighting across Europe for 2012–2013 and 2014–2020. These show a regionally widespread spectral shift, from that associated principally with high-pressure sodium lighting to that associated with broad white light-emitting diodes and with greater blue emissions. Reexpressing the color maps in terms of spectral indicators of environmental pressures, we find that this trend is widely increasing the risk of harmful effects to ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quality assessment of systematic literature on uterine fibroids: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a research methodology that examines data and findings of other authors relative to specified research questions (RQ), collects multiple research studies, and summarises them to answer a research question using rigorous methods. Many SLRs have been published on uterine fibroids (UFs) in the last two decades but there is a dearth of knowledge on assessment of the quality to determine the reliability of results. Methods: This study employed the SLR method to identify available SLRs published on UFs. Dybå and Dingsøyr quality standards and dichotomous grading scales were employed to determine the quality of primary studies. On February 3rd, 2022, an auto search was conducted twice over Citeseer, EBSCO, ACM, Springer Link, IEE Computer society digital library, and Scopus using 17 search strings. Two teams independently screened papers and compared notes with the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 11 criterial were adapted to evaluate the quality of the SLR’s. Results: 33 SLRs were subjected to data extraction after inclusion/exclusion criteria. Answers to our primary research question was positive as the aims and contexts of the SLRs are generally clear and the methodologies employed are all inclusive. The research outputs of the primary studies are valid and justifiable as their research statements were clear and findings unambiguous. Although some studies failed some quality criteria, answers to all RQs were affirmative as the percentage scores of the studies on each of the quality conditions is favourably high. Conclusions: The auto search may be incomplete because some qualified SLRs may have been missed as the choice of search strings was limited and may have omitted terminologies. Notwithstanding, with average quality scores of 83% in reporting, 81.2% in rigour, and 79% in credibility, this study concludes that majority of the meta-analysis published so far on UF are valid and reliable.

                Background: Rasmussen’s encephalitis (RE) is a rare chronic neurological disorder that presents with progressive neurological and cognitive deterioration, and intractable seizures that lacks definitive management. We aimed to identify case reports of RE in the literature to assess the treatment based on the symptoms and outcomes after the treatment. Methods: We searched the databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library from 1990 to 22nd February 2022 in order to review the case reports that included the treatment options and clinical outcomes of RE. A pre-established protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (ID: CRD42021261999). Results: The mean age of onset of seizure was 31.44 and 6.87 years in adult onset RE and children (below 15 years of age) with RE respectively. A total of four (44.44%) out of nine adult patients and 81 (66.39%) out of 122 children underwent surgery. Tacrolimus was used in 17 (13.93%) and steroid therapy was used in 11 (9.01%) of the children. Conclusions: Large scale-controlled trials are needed to study the beneficial effect of tacrolimus, IV Ig, and plasma therapy. Hemispherectomy should be opted as a treatment modality by assessing the impairment of patients’ motor or language functions following the treatment procedure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Observational study: determinants for vegetable consumption among elementary school students in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The prevalence of obesity in school children has been increasing worldwide, including in developing countries such as Indonesia. Childhood obesity is associated with an unbalanced diet, especially the lack of fruit and vegetable consumption. This study aimed to determine the factors that influence vegetable consumption behavior in school children in Indonesia. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted in eight public elementary schools in a suburban area of Bogor Regency involving 433 students from the fifth grade. Data collection was conducted from November to December 2018. Data on the students’ characteristics, knowledge, and attitude as well as availability of vegetables at home and at school were collected using a structured questionnaire. While, a 24-hour food recall was utilized to obtain information on vegetable consumption and overall diet. Data analysis was done using Chi-squared test and logistic regression. Results: The average daily intake of vegetables was 47.11 g, far below the recommend amount (250 g). Female students had significantly better vegetables intake compared with their male counterparts. The availability of vegetables at home and students’ positive attitude toward vegetables were also significantly associated with better vegetable intake. Logistic regression analysis showed that availability of vegetables at home almost tripled the likelihood of better vegetable consumption (OR 2.822, 95% CI  1.822–4.372). Additionally, availability of vegetables at school and positive attitude toward vegetables doubled the odd for better vegetable consumption, OR 2.2 and 2.1 respectively (p<0.005). Conclusions: Vegetable consumption among schoolchildren was very low compared with the recommended portion. Better vegetable consumption was significantly associated with sex, availability, and students’ attitudes. Vegetable availability at home was the strongest determinant influencing vegetable consumption among elementary school students involved in the study. Hence, parental support or home food environment is key in improving their diet quality to prevent obesity.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Small molecule screening identifies Syk kinase inhibition and Rutaecarpine as modulators of macrophage training and SARS CoV-2 infection</a></h4>

              
                Innate immune training of macrophages can impart long-term modulation. John et al. show that Syk inhibition and rutaecarpine treatment can impart similarly long-term modulatory effects in macrophages. Using a treatment/resting regime, Syk inhibitor reduces susceptibility to viruses, including SARS CoV2, while rutaecarpine reverses LPS tolerance and beta-glucan induced training.
