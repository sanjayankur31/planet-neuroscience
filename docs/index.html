<p>In the jataí stingless bee (<i>Tetragonisca angustula</i>), body size plays an important role in the division of labor among workers. Larger workers (soldiers) take over defensive roles while smaller workers (foragers) engage in foraging activities. Nest defense performed by soldiers includes two different tasks: (1) hovering around the nest entrance for the detection and interception of heterospecific bees (a task relying mostly on vision) and (2) standing at the nest entrance tube for inspection of returning foragers and discrimination against conspecific non-nestmates based on olfactory cues. In our study, the most important finding is that between soldiers, hoverers had larger brain compartments related to visual processing (the optic lobes) and learning (the mushroom bodies). Brain size differences we report thus correspond to behavioral specialization in defense and illustrate a functional neuroplasticity underpinning division of labor.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Social insects are instructive models for understanding the association between investment in brain size and behavioral variability because they show a relatively simple nervous system associated with a large set of complex behaviors. In the jataí stingless bee (<i>Tetragonisca angustula</i>), division of labor relies both on age and body size differences among workers. When young, both minors and soldiers engage in intranidal tasks and move to extranidal tasks as they age. Minors switch to foraging activities, while soldiers take over defensive roles. Nest defense performed by soldiers includes two different tasks: (1) <i>hovering</i> around the nest entrance for the detection and interception of heterospecific bees (a task relying mostly on vision) and (2) <i>standing</i> at the nest entrance tube for inspection of returning foragers and discrimination against conspecific non-nestmates based on olfactory cues. Here, using different-sized individuals (minors and soldiers) as well as same-sized individuals (hovering and standing soldiers) performing distinct tasks, we investigated the effects of both morphological and behavioral variability on brain size. We found a negative allometric growth between brain size and body size across jataí workers, meaning that minors had relatively larger brains than soldiers. Between soldier types, we found that hovering soldiers had larger brain compartments related to visual processing (the optic lobes) and learning (the mushroom bodies). Brain size differences between jataí soldiers thus correspond to behavioral specialization in defense (i.e., vision for hovering soldiers) and illustrate a functional neuroplasticity underpinning division of labor.</p>

                As research becomes more interdisciplinary, fast-paced, data-intensive, and collaborative, there is an increasing need to share data and other research products in accordance with Open Science principles. In response to this need, we created an Open Science & Data Collaborations (OSDC) program at the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries that provides Open Science tools, training, collaboration opportunities, and community-building events to support Open Research and Open Science adoption. This program presents a unique end-to-end model for Open Science programs because it extends open science support beyond open repositories and open access publishing to the entire research lifecycle. We developed a logic model and a preliminary assessment metrics framework to evaluate the impact of the program activities based on existing data collected through event and workshop registrations and platform usage. The combination of these evaluation instruments has provided initial insight into our service productivity and impact. It will further help to answer more in-depth questions regarding the program impact, launch targeted surveys, and identify priority service areas and interesting Open Science projects.

                EMBL-EBI, Europe's biomolecular data hub, is a world leader in managing and analysing big data in biology and making it freely available to scientists worldwide. Researchers can access the open data resources and related services of EMBL-EBI by submitting minimal personal data. In May 2018, following the enforcement of the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), EMBL adopted the EMBL Internal Policy no. 68 on General Data Protection. It reflects European data protection principles while remaining within the bounds of EMBL's international legal status. As a result of GDPR and EMBL's Internal Policy No. 68 coming into force, 190 EMBL-EBI user-facing services that processed personal data in 2018 were required to have Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) and Privacy Notices (PN). EMBL-EBI's solution was to develop a Data Protection Engine (DPE) that automatically generates RoPA and PN when a service owner answers a series of questions. In addition to maintaining a centrally located database for RoPAs and PNs, the DPE tracks changes to the documents, as well as providing versioning and time-stamped updates. It is the aim of this article to share the EMBL-EBI IT department’s experience with designing and implementing the DPE and providing a toolkit to let others develop a similar solution and benefit from our experience. Implementation steps, benefits, challenges, opportunities, and practices are discussed and critically analysed.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Conflict and competition between model-based and model-free control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuqing Lei, Alec Solway</p>

A large literature has accumulated suggesting that human and animal decision making is driven by at least two systems, and that important functions of these systems can be captured by reinforcement learning algorithms. The “model-free” system caches and uses stimulus–value or stimulus–response associations, and the “model-based” system implements more flexible planning using a model of the world. However, it is not clear how the two systems interact during deliberation and how a single decision emerges from this process, especially when they disagree. Most previous work has assumed that while the systems operate in parallel, they do so independently, and they combine linearly to influence decisions. Using an integrated reinforcement learning/drift-diffusion model, we tested the hypothesis that the two systems interact in a non-linear fashion similar to other situations with cognitive conflict. We differentiated two forms of conflict: <i>action conflict</i>, a binary state representing whether the systems disagreed on the best action, and <i>value conflict</i>, a continuous measure of the extent to which the two systems disagreed on the difference in value between the available options. We found that decisions with greater value conflict were characterized by reduced model-based control and increased caution both with and without action conflict. Action conflict itself (the binary state) acted in the opposite direction, although its effects were less prominent. We also found that between-system conflict was highly correlated with within-system conflict, and although it is less clear a priori why the latter might influence the strength of each system above its standard linear contribution, we could not rule it out. Our work highlights the importance of non-linear conflict effects, and provides new constraints for more detailed process models of decision making. It also presents new avenues to explore with relation to disorders of compulsivity, where an imbalance between systems has been implicated.

Despite the rapid creation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, the precise correlates of immunity against severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still unknown. Neutralizing antibodies represent a robust surrogate of protection in early Phase III studies, but vaccines provide protection prior to the evolution of neutralization, vaccines provide protection against variants that evade neutralization, and vaccines continue to provide protection against disease severity in the setting of waning neutralizing titers. Thus, in this study, using an Ad26.CoV2.S dose-down approach in nonhuman primates (NHPs), the role of neutralization, Fc effector function, and T-cell immunity were collectively probed against infection as well as against viral control. While dosing-down minimally impacted neutralizing and binding antibody titers, Fc receptor binding and functional antibody levels were induced in a highly dose-dependent manner. Neutralizing antibody and Fc receptor binding titers, but minimally T cells, were linked to the prevention of transmission. Conversely, Fc receptor binding/function and T cells were linked to antiviral control, with a minimal role for neutralization. These data point to dichotomous roles of neutralization and T-cell function in protection against transmission and disease severity and a continuous role for Fc effector function as a correlate of immunity key to halting and controlling SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Do multiple experimenters improve the reproducibility of animal studies?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vanessa Tabea von Kortzfleisch, Oliver Ambrée, Natasha A. Karp, Neele Meyer, Janja Novak, Rupert Palme, Marianna Rosso, Chadi Touma, Hanno Würbel, Sylvia Kaiser, Norbert Sachser, S. Helene Richter</p>

The credibility of scientific research has been seriously questioned by the widely claimed “reproducibility crisis”. In light of this crisis, there is a growing awareness that the rigorous standardisation of experimental conditions may contribute to poor reproducibility of animal studies. Instead, systematic heterogenisation has been proposed as a tool to enhance reproducibility, but a real-life test across multiple independent laboratories is still pending. The aim of this study was therefore to test whether heterogenisation of experimental conditions by using multiple experimenters improves the reproducibility of research findings compared to standardised conditions with only one experimenter. To this end, we replicated the same animal experiment in 3 independent laboratories, each employing both a heterogenised and a standardised design. Whereas in the standardised design, all animals were tested by a single experimenter; in the heterogenised design, 3 different experimenters were involved in testing the animals. In contrast to our expectation, the inclusion of multiple experimenters in the heterogenised design did not improve the reproducibility of the results across the 3 laboratories. Interestingly, however, a variance component analysis indicated that the variation introduced by the different experimenters was not as high as the variation introduced by the laboratories, probably explaining why this heterogenisation strategy did not bring the anticipated success. Even more interestingly, for the majority of outcome measures, the remaining residual variation was identified as an important source of variance accounting for 41% (CI<sub>95</sub> [34%, 49%]) to 72% (CI<sub>95</sub> [58%, 88%]) of the observed total variance. Despite some uncertainty surrounding the estimated numbers, these findings argue for systematically including biological variation rather than eliminating it in animal studies and call for future research on effective improvement strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Environmental perceptions of global business travel by Swiss companies in the Zurich airport region [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This article presents findings from research conducted before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on companies located in the Zurich airport region of Switzerland, regarding the needs for global business travel and its impacts. Methods: The study involved a mixed methods approach. Five hypotheses were tested using inferential statistics on data obtained from pre-tested closed questions in a web-based survey. Deeper context was explored through an interview-based case-study conducted at a Swiss pharma company. Results: Supporting alternative hypothesis 3 (Ha(3)), a significant positive relationship was found between travel frequency and business growth, F(1, 100) = 11.31, p = 0.0011. Supporting Ha(4), corporate culture had a significant positive relationship with business travel frequency (F(1, 100) = 15.50, p = 0.0002) and average trip length (F(1, 100) = 6.39, p = 0.01). And thirdly supporting Ha(5), corporate social responsibility had a significant relationship with global business travel (91%). Ho(2) and Ho(3) were accepted. The case study found that smart corporate travel policies and regulations should be instantiated to enhance our environment, which would also benefit employee wellbeing. Travel can be reduced significantly despite being demonstrated that physical co-presence is important for building trust. The case study suggests tools to support the monitoring and management of global business travel by organizations. Conclusions: COVID-19 has impacted travel for business significantly, and future research will be necessary to assess its impact. The article explores the ongoing research in this area, and several relevant implications are proposed for future leaders. The case study found willingness to pay both corporate and individual green taxes, and a deficiency in corporate communication around the environment. Business travel is needed to build trust; however, it can be reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A qualitative study of sexual violence and attribution of responsibility in Georgian youth [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sexual violence is a complex and pressing social issue that needs urgent solutions. Republic of Georgia is one of those countries where despite some advancements in law and practice, patriarchal beliefs and behaviour patterns still prevail in a daily life. So far, there has not been undertaken an in-depth study on how Georgians and particularly youth, define sexual violence and what are the justifications behind these views. The aim of the research is to understand how Georgian students understand sexual violence, who they think are responsible for sexual violence and what are the underlying reasons behind those views. Method: In total, 37 in-depth interviews have been conducted with Georgian students, from September of 2019 to March of 2021. The study participants were recruited from different universities, including the two biggest cities of Georgia - Tbilisi and Batumi.   Results: The research revealed that understanding of sexual violence is far more complex than it was expected. Georgian students define sexual violence as a broad category where sexual harassment and sexual coercion have overlapping and at the same time independent meaning. Interpretation and attribution of responsibility in all three categories are dependent on situations and context that contain not only physical violence but also inappropriate touch, insistent gaze, comments about body parts, sexist insults and discrimination, messages of sexual content, psychological pressure and blackmailing. Attribution of responsibility was equally dependent on personal judgements as well as culturally determined stereotypes. Conclusion: Sexual violence is not a new phenomenon in Georgia, but its consideration as a social problem is. The research demonstrated that understanding and judgment on sexual violence, sexual harassment and sexual coercion is nuanced issue and still needs clear categories of definitions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Crisis-management, Anti-stigma, and Mental Health Literacy Program for University Students (CAMPUS): A preliminary evaluation of suicide prevention [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: University students have specific risk factors for suicide, necessitating targeted prevention programs. This preliminary study evaluated the efficacy of the Crisis-management, Anti-stigma, Mental health literacy Program for University Students (CAMPUS) for reduction of risk factors and promotion of preventative behaviors. Methods: A total of 136 medical students attended the CAMPUS as a required course at the national university in Japan. The CAMPUS consisted of a lecture and two group sessions covering mental health literacy, self-stigma, and gatekeeper efficacy (e.g., identifying and helping at-risk individuals). The students were asked to role-play based on a movie about gatekeepers and scripts about self-stigma and suicide-related issues. Participants completed questionnaires on suicidal thoughts, depression, help-seeking intentions, self-efficacy as gatekeepers, self-concealment, and self-acceptance. A total of 121 students completed the questionnaires pre- and post-program, and 107 students also responded six months later. Results: Students demonstrated significantly reduced overall suicide thoughts six months post-program compared to before the program. In addition, gatekeeper self-efficacy, help-seeking intentions for formal resources, and self-acceptance were improved in the students six month after the program. Conclusions: The CAMPUS suggested effective at reducing suicidal people and promoting preventative psychological tendencies among medial students. This study was a one-group pre post design study without control group. The CAMPUS program was delivered as a mandatory requirement to a group with relatively low suicide risk. Further studies are required to assess its suitability for the general university student population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling sociodemographic factors that affect malaria prevalence in Sussundenga, Mozambique: a cross-sectional study. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malaria is still one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in Mozambique with little progress in malaria control over the past 20 years. Sussundenga is one of most affected areas. Malaria transmission has a strong association with environmental and sociodemographic factors. The knowledge of sociodemographic factors that affects malaria, may be used to improve the strategic planning for its control. Currently such studies have not been performed in Sussundenga. Thus, the objective of this study is to model the relationship between malaria and sociodemographic factors in Sussundenga, Mozambique. Methods: Houses in the study area were digitalized and enumerated using Google Earth Pro version 7.3. In this study 100 houses were randomly selected to conduct a community survey of Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence using rapid diagnostic test (RDT). During the survey, a questionnaire was conducted to assess the sociodemographic factors of the participants. Descriptive statistics were analyzed and backward stepwise logistic regression was performed establishing a relationship between positive cases and the factors. The analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20 package. Results: The overall P. falciparum prevalence was 31.6%. Half of the malaria positive cases occurred in age group 5 to 14 years. Previous malaria treatment, population density and age group were significant predictors for the model. The model explained 13.5% of the variance in malaria positive cases and sensitivity of the final model was 73.3%. Conclusion: In this area the highest burden of P. falciparum infection was among those aged 5–14 years old. Malaria infection was related to sociodemographic factors. Targeting malaria control at community level can combat the disease more effectively than waiting for cases at health centers. These finding can be used to guide more effective interventions in this region.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of exercise training on cardiotoxicity in cancer survivors. A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Cardiotoxicity is a major long-term complication of anti-cancer drugs such as anthracycline and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). These drugs also impact the quality of life, reduced functional capacity, and life expectancy. Exercise attenuates the cardiotoxic effects of anticancer treatments, as indicated by a growing body of evidence.   Methods:  Studies for this review were retrieved from databases PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, COCHRANE, and Web of Science and were restricted only to clinical trials. Study results were screened and synchronized to Mendeley. Studies that met the eligibility criteria were extracted into the spreadsheet, summarizing information regarding the site and cancer stages, adjuvant therapy, various exercise interventions, and outcome measures. Risk of bias quality analysis was done in accordance with the National Heart Lung Blood Institute.  Results:    In this systematic review, 9021 articles were screened. After the exclusion criteria, seven articles were included for qualitative analysis. Outcome measures analyzed were measures of cardiotoxicity such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac biomarkers, and global longitudinal strain.  Conclusion:  Although a structured exercise protocol including aerobic and resistance training has been found to improve, the functional capacity is an indirect measure of cardiotoxicity. There is a lack of data in terms of improvement seen in direct measurements of cardiotoxicity such as LVEF and cardiac biomarkers. A lack of evidence regarding the effects of exercise on the direct measurement of cardiotoxicity encourages the need for further research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Acute Kidney Injury associated with "Triple whammy" combination: a protocol for a systematic review. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: “Triple whammy” (TW) refers to the simultaneous use of diuretics, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). To date, the risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) associated to this combination has not been deeply investigated. The objectives are to analyze the incidence of AKI associated to the exposure to “triple whammy” including all NSAIDs versus non-exposure to this combination. Secondarily, the risk of hospitalization, severe adverse events, requirement of renal replacement therapy and mortality will be assessed. Also, the incidence of AKI associated to the exposure to “triple whammy” versus non-exposure will be analyzed, including only metamizole as NSAID.   Methods: A systematic literature search of intervention studies and analytical observational studies will be conducted in the Cochrane Library, Medline and EMBASE, among others. AKI 12 months after the last prescription of the triple combination will be the main outcome. Relative frequencies, risk of bias and certainty of evidence will be analyzed. Additionally, sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be performed.   Results: Once this systematic review has been completed, the results are expected to provide an estimate of the risk associated with this triple combination and the renal variables, in addition to new guidance on the renal treatment of patients potentially receiving triple therapy.  Conclusions: This is intended to be the first systematic review of observational studies to analyse TW combination and AKI's risk based on well-validated epidemiological databases exploring drug safety issues.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of leukocyte nadir with complete remission in Indonesian acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing 7+3 remission induction chemotherapy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The 7+3 regimen is still the main choice of remission induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Successfully achieving complete remission (CR) and the time required to achieve it determine patient’s survival. Hence, bone marrow examination on 14th day of chemotherapy is recommended to predict CR. However, the examination is invasive and still inaccurate. Methods: A prognostic study with retrospective cohort design was conducted at two central hospitals in Indonesia based on medical record data of AML patients who underwent 7+3 induction chemotherapy from January 1st, 2015, to December 31st, 2019. The association of nadir leukocyte level and the time required to achieve it with CR occurrence was assessed. Results: One hundred and one subjects were recruited with median age 39 years and 55% men. A total of 55.4% subjects achieved CR. Nadir leukocyte level below 200/mcl was the most optimal cut-off point and independently associated with CR (OR 2.45; 95% CI 1.01–5.94) while time required to achieve it was not. Conclusions: The nadir leukocyte level is associated with an increase probability of CR but not for the time required to achieve it in AML patients undergoing 7+3 induction chemotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of the knowledge, attitudes and practices of Lebanese shoppers towards food labeling: The first steps in the Nutri-score roadmap [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Food labeling is a fundamental educational tool for advocating for public awareness. It emphasizes knowledge of the nutrient content of food and thus directs the choice towards the healthiest food products. This cross-sectional survey aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding nutrition label use in Lebanon through a valid questionnaire. Methods: Overall, 768 participants (mean age: 30.8 ±12, males: 60.2%) were recruited randomly between February and May 2020. We used word of mouth and social media to recruit our sample population. Results: Social media was the most accessed tool to attain nutrition information by responders (39.8%). More than half the participants expressed positive attitudes to check information related to sugars (66.4%), vitamins (64.9%), total fats (61.7%), proteins (59.1%), and calories (58.7%) on the food label. Expiry date, price, and brand name were the top three considerations while reading food labels. About half (46.5%) reported to “always” look at the food label. Responders reported reading labels related primarily to sugars (44.3%), calories (38.8%), and total fats (36.8%). The optimal total KAP score was 46; our findings revealed a mean KAP score of 14.46 ±7 (31.4%). When categorizing the KAP scores, 15% had high scores, and 85% scored low. Spearman’s coefficients showed positive correlations between knowledge-attitude, knowledge-practice, and attitude-practice scores, with p<0.001. The regression analysis revealed that gender, age, BMI, residency area, educational level, university degree, health and diet statuses, and activity level were significant predictors of the KAP score. Being on a diet had the highest odds (OR=3.107, CI=1.904-5.072, p<0.001). Conclusion: The low awareness of food labels leads Lebanese people to choose unhealthy food options. A planned educational program is recommended to ease the interpretation of these labels.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 05 May 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01064-y">doi:10.1038/s41593-022-01064-y</a></p>Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area bidirectionally regulate the activity of serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Low-strength activity causes inhibition via dopamine receptor D2, whereas high- strength activity causes activation via dopamine receptor D1, and this circuit contributes to anorexia nervosa-like behaviors in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Using positional information to provide context for biological image analysis with MorphoGraphX 2.0</a></h4>

              
                Positional information is a central concept in developmental biology. In developing organs, positional information can be idealized as a local coordinate system that arises from morphogen gradients controlled by organizers at key locations. This offers a plausible mechanism for the integration of the molecular networks operating in individual cells into the spatially-coordinated multicellular responses necessary for the organization of emergent forms. Understanding how positional cues guide morphogenesis requires the quantification of gene expression and growth dynamics in the context of their underlying coordinate systems. Here we present recent advances in the MorphoGraphX software (Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015)⁠ that implement a generalized framework to annotate developing organs with local coordinate systems. These coordinate systems introduce an organ-centric spatial context to microscopy data, allowing gene expression and growth to be quantified and compared in the context of the positional information thought to control them.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tubulinopathy mutations in TUBA1A that disrupt neuronal morphogenesis and migration override XMAP215/Stu2 regulation of microtubule dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Heterozygous, missense mutations in a- or b-tubulin genes are associated with a wide range of human brain malformations, known as tubulinopathies. We seek to understand whether a mutation’s impact at the molecular and cellular levels scale with the severity of brain malformation. Here we focus on two mutations at the valine 409 residue of TUBA1A, V409I and V409A, identified in patients with pachygyria or lissencephaly, respectively. We find that ectopic expression of <i>TUBA1A</i>-V409I/A mutants disrupt neuronal migration in mice and promote excessive neurite branching and a decrease in the number of neurite retraction events in primary rat neuronal cultures. These neuronal phenotypes are accompanied by increased microtubule acetylation and polymerization rates. To determine the molecular mechanisms, we modeled the V409I/A mutants in budding yeast and found that they promote intrinsically faster microtubule polymerization rates in cells and in reconstitution experiments with purified tubulin. In addition, V409I/A mutants decrease the recruitment of XMAP215/Stu2 to plus ends in budding yeast and ablate tubulin binding to TOG domains. In each assay tested, the <i>TUBA1A</i>-V409I mutant exhibits an intermediate phenotype between wild type and the more severe <i>TUBA1A</i>-V409A, reflecting the severity observed in brain malformations. Together, our data support a model in which the V409I/A mutations disrupt microtubule regulation typically conferred by XMAP215 proteins during neuronal morphogenesis and migration, and this impact on tubulin activity at the molecular level scales with the impact at the cellular and tissue levels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Anatomical and functional connectivity support the existence of a salience network node within the caudal ventrolateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Three large-scale brain networks are considered essential to cognitive flexibility: the ventral and dorsal attention (VANet and DANet) and salience (SNet) networks. The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) is a known component of the VANet and DANet, but there is an important gap in the current knowledge regarding its involvement in the SNet. In this study, we used a translational and multimodal approach to fulfill this gap and demonstrate the existence of a SNet node within the vlPFC. First, we used tract-tracing methods in non-human primates (NHP) to quantify the anatomical connectivity strength between the different vlPFC areas and the frontal and insular cortices. The strongest connections with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI) locations comprising the two main cortical SNet nodes were derived from the caudal area 47/12. This location also has strong axonal projections to subcortical structures of the salience network, including the dorsomedial thalamus, hypothalamus, sublenticular extended amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Second, we used a seed-based functional connectivity analysis in NHP resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) data to validate the caudal area 47/12 as an SNet node. Third, we used the same approach in human rsfMRI data to identify a homologous structure in caudal area 47/12, also showing strong connections with the SNet cortical nodes, thus confirming the caudal area 47/12 as the SNet node in the vlPFC. Taken together, the vlPFC contains nodes for all three cognitive networks, the VANet, DANet, and SNet. Thus, the vlPFC is in a position to switch between these three cognitive networks, pointing to a key role as an attentional hub. Its tight additional connections to the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, and ventral premotor cortices, places the vlPFC at the center for switching behaviors based on environmental stimuli, computing value and cognitive control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endothelial SIRPα signaling controls VE-cadherin endocytosis for thymic homing of progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                Thymic homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) is tightly regulated for proper T cell development. Previously we have identified a subset of specialized thymic portal endothelial cells (TPECs), which is important for thymic HPC homing. However, the underlying molecular mechanism still remains unknown. Here, we found that signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) is preferentially expressed on TPECs. Disruption of CD47-SIRPα signaling in mice resulted in reduced number of thymic early T cell progenitors (ETPs), impaired thymic HPC homing, and altered early development of thymocytes. Mechanistically, <i>Sirpa</i>-deficient ECs and <i>Cd47</i>-deficient bone marrow progenitor cells or T lymphocytes demonstrated impaired transendothelial migration (TEM). Specifically, SIRPα intracellular ITIM motif-initiated downstream signaling in ECs was found to be required for TEM in an SHP2- and Src-dependent manner. Furthermore, CD47 signaling from migrating cells and SIRPα intracellular signaling were found to be required for VE-cadherin endocytosis in ECs. Thus, our study reveals a novel role of endothelial SIRPα signaling for thymic HPC homing for T cell development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Heterogeneity of the GFP fitness landscape and data-driven protein design</a></h4>

              
                Studies of protein fitness landscapes reveal biophysical constraints guiding protein evolution and empower prediction of functional proteins. However, generalisation of these findings is limited due to scarceness of systematic data on fitness landscapes of proteins with a defined evolutionary relationship. We characterized the fitness peaks of four orthologous fluorescent proteins with a broad range of sequence divergence. While two of the four studied fitness peaks were sharp, the other two were considerably flatter, being almost entirely free of epistatic interactions. Mutationally robust proteins, characterized by a flat fitness peak, were not optimal templates for machine-learning-driven protein design - instead, predictions were more accurate for fragile proteins with epistatic landscapes. Our work paves insights for practical application of fitness landscape heterogeneity in protein engineering.

                While screening our in-house 1072 marketed drugs for their ability to extend the lifespan using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) as an animal model, crotamiton (<i>N</i>-ethyl-o-crotonotoluidide) showed anti-aging activity and was selected for further structural optimization. After replacing the ortho-methyl of crotamiton with ortho-fluoro, crotamiton derivative JM03 was obtained and showed better activity in terms of lifespan-extension and stress resistance than crotamiton. It was further explored that JM03 extended the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i> through osmotic avoidance abnormal-9 (OSM-9). Besides, JM03 improves the ability of nematode to resist oxidative stress and hypertonic stress through OSM-9, but not osm-9/capsaicin receptor related-2 (OCR-2). Then the inhibition of OSM-9 by JM03 reduces the aggregation of Q35 in <i>C. elegans</i> via upregulating the genes associated with proteostasis. SKN-1 signaling was also found to be activated after JM03 treatment, which might contribute to proteostasis, stress resistance and lifespan extension. In summary, this study explored a new small molecule derived from crotamiton, which has efficient anti-oxidative, anti-hypertonic, and anti-aging effects, and could further lead to promising application prospects.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and protective antiviral immunity by MRI</a></h4>

              
                Central nervous system (CNS) infections are a major cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Even patients that survive CNS infections can have lasting neurological dysfunction resulting from immune and pathogen induced pathology. Developing approaches to noninvasively track pathology and immunity in the infected CNS is crucial for patient management and development of new therapeutics. Here, we develop novel MRI-based approaches to monitor virus-specific CD8+ T cells and their relationship to cerebrovascular pathology in the living brain. We studied a relevant murine model in which a neurotropic virus (vesicular stomatitis virus) was introduced intranasally and then entered the brain via olfactory sensory neurons - a route exploited by many pathogens in humans. Using T2*-weighted high-resolution MRI, we identified small cerebral microbleeds as an early form of pathology associated with viral entry into the brain. Mechanistically, these microbleeds occurred in the absence of peripheral immune cells and were associated with infection of vascular endothelial cells. We monitored the adaptive response to this infection by developing methods to iron label and track individual virus specific CD8+ T cells by MRI. Transferred antiviral T cells were detected in the brain within a day of infection and were able to reduce cerebral microbleeds. These data demonstrate the utility of MRI in detecting the earliest pathological events in the virally infected CNS as well as the therapeutic potential of antiviral T cells in mitigating this pathology.

                Overlapping coding regions balance selective forces between multiple genes. One possible division of nucleotide sequence is that the predominant selective force on a particular nucleotide can be attributed to just one gene. While this arrangement has been observed in regions in which one gene is structured and the other is disordered, we sought to explore how overlapping genes balance constraints when both protein products are structured over the same sequence. We use a combination of sequence analysis, functional assays and selection experiments to examine an overlapped region in HIV-1 that encodes helical regions in both Env and Rev. We find that functional segregation occurs even in this overlap, with each protein spacing its functional residues in a manner that allows a mutable non-binding face of one helix to encode important functional residues on a charged face in the other helix. Additionally, our experiments reveal novel and critical functional residues in Env and have implications for the therapeutic targeting of HIV-1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Kv3.3 subunits control presynaptic action potential waveform and neurotransmitter release at a central excitatory synapse</a></h4>

              
                Kv3 potassium currents mediate rapid repolarization of action potentials (APs), supporting fast spikes and high repetition rates. Of the four Kv3 gene family members, Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 are highly expressed in the auditory brainstem and we exploited this to test for subunit-specific roles at the calyx of Held presynaptic terminal in the mouse. Deletion of Kv3.3 (but not Kv3.1) reduced presynaptic Kv3 channel immunolabelling, increased presynaptic AP duration and facilitated excitatory transmitter release; which in turn enhanced short-term depression during high frequency transmission. The response to sound was delayed in the Kv3.3KO, with higher spontaneous and lower evoked firing, thereby reducing signal-to-noise ratio. Computational modelling showed that the enhanced EPSC and short-term depression in the Kv3.3KO reflected increased vesicle release probability and accelerated activity-dependent vesicle replenishment. We conclude that Kv3.3 mediates fast repolarization for short precise APs, conserving transmission during sustained high-frequency activity at this glutamatergic excitatory synapse.

                Visual perception waxes and wanes periodically as a function of the phase of low-frequency brain oscillations (theta, 4-7 Hz; alpha, 8-13 Hz) [1-9]. Perceptual cycles are defined as the corresponding periodic modulation of perceptual performance (review [10, 11]). Here, using psychophysics, we tested the hypothesis that brain oscillations travel across the visual cortex, leading to predictable perceptual consequences across the visual field, i.e., perceptual cycles travel across the retinotopic visual space. An oscillating disk (inducer) was presented in the periphery of the visual field to induce brain oscillations at low frequencies (4, 6, 8 or 10 Hz) at a specific retinotopic cortical location. Target stimuli at threshold (50% detection) were displayed at random times during the periodic disk stimulation, at one of three possible distances from the disk. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants performed a detection task. EEG analyses showed that the periodic stimulation produced a complex brain oscillation composed of the induced frequency and its first harmonic likely due to the overlap of the periodic response and the neural response to individual stimuli. This complex oscillation, which originated from a precise retinotopic position, modulated detection performance periodically at each target position and at each frequency. Critically, the optimal behavioral phase, i.e., of highest performance, of the 8 Hz and 10 Hz oscillations (alpha range) consistently shifted across target distance to the inducer. Together, the results demonstrate that alpha-induced perceptual cycles traveled across the retinotopic space in human observers at a propagation speed between 0.2 and 0.4 m/s.

                Sleep has long been considered as a state of disconnection from the environment, with absent reactivity to external stimuli. Here, we questioned this sleep disconnection dogma by directly investigating behavioral responsiveness in 49 napping subjects (27 with narcolepsy and 22 healthy volunteers) engaged in a lexical decision task. Participants were instructed to frown or smile depending on the stimulus type (words vs pseudo-words). We found accurate behavioral responses, visible via contractions of the corrugator or zygomatic muscles, in all sleep stages in both groups (except slow-wave sleep for healthy volunteers). Stimuli presented during states with high (vs. low) values of neural markers indexing rich cognitive states more often yielded responses. Our findings suggest that transient windows of reactivity to external stimuli exist in all sleep stages, even in healthy individuals. Such windows of reactivity could be used to probe sleep-related mental and cognitive processes in real-time across all sleep stages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ribotoxic collisions on CAG expansions disrupt proteostasis and stress responses in Huntington's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions encoding a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene1. Although mutant HTT (mHTT) protein tends to aggregate, the exact causes of neurotoxicity in HD remain unclear2. Here we show that altered elongation kinetics on CAG expansions cause ribosome collisions that trigger ribotoxicity, proteotoxicity and maladaptive stress responses. CAG expansions cause an elongation rate conflict during HTT translation, when ribosomes rapidly decoding the optimal polyQ encounter a flanking slowly-decoded polyproline tract. The ensuing ribosome collisions lead to premature termination and release of aggregation-prone mHTT fragments. Due to the presence of a stress-responsive upstream open reading frame (uORF), HTT translation and aggregation are limited under normal conditions but enhanced under stress, seeding a vicious cycle of dysfunction. mHTT further exacerbates ribotoxicity by progressively sequestering eIF5A, a key regulator of translation elongation, polyamine metabolism and stress responses. eIF5A depletion in HD cells leads to widespread ribosome pausing on eIF5A-dependent sites, impaired cotranslational proteostasis, disrupted polyamine metabolism and maladaptive stress responses. Importantly, drugs that reduce translation initiation attenuate ribosome collisions and mitigate this escalating cascade of ribotoxic stress and dysfunction in HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparative study between radiofrequency- and muscimol-induced inhibition of cultured networks of cortical neuron</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that spontaneously active cultured networks of cortical neuron grown planar microelectrode array are sensitive to radiofrequency (RF) fields and exhibit an inhibitory response more pronounced as the exposure time and power increase. To better understand the mechanism behind the observed effects, we aimed at identifying similarities and dissimilarities between the inhibitory effect of RF fields (continuous wave, 1800 MHz) to the {gamma}-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A ) receptor agonist muscimol (MU). Inhibition of network bursting activity in response to RF exposure became apparent at an SAR level of 28.6 W/kg and co-occurred with an elevation of the culture medium temperature of ~1 {degrees}C. Differently to a pharmacological inhibition with MU, exposure to RF fields preferentially inhibits bursting over spiking activity and exerts less constrains on neural network bursting synchrony. Network rebound excitation, a phenomenon relying on intrinsic properties of cortical neurons, was observed consecutively to the removal of tonic hyperpolarization after washout of MU but not in response to cessation of RF exposure which implies that hyperpolarization is not the main driving force mediating the inhibitory effects of RF fields. At the level of single neurons, network inhibition induced by MU and RF fields occurred with reduced action potential (AP) half-width. As change in AP waveform tightly influence efficiency of synaptic transmission, the narrowing effect on AP seen under RF exposure might contribute to reduce network bursting activity. By pointing only to a partial overlap between the inhibitory hallmarks of these two forms of inhibition, our data suggest that the inhibitory mechanisms of action of RF fields differ from the ones mediated by the activation of GABA A receptor. The rapid onset of the inhibitory effect of RF fields and its reversibility strikingly similar to MU are in favour of a mechanism interacting with fast operating targets at the membrane such as ion channels.

                In the mouse, more than 1,100 odorant receptors (ORs) are expressed in a monogenic and monoallelic fashion, referred to as singular gene expression. Using a 21bp singular-choice enhancer (x21), we radically increase representation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) choosing a 5x21 enhanced OR transgene, but not overexpression of its mRNA on a per cell basis. RNA-sequencing and differential expression analysis identified 425 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). ORs make up 86% of all DEGs, of which 325 have decreased representation and 40 have increased representation. Underrepresented ORs include Class I, Class II and TAAR genes and within each of their respective olfactory bulb domains: DI, DII, and DIII (TAAR) we committedly observe multiple homogeneous glomeruli with an OR1A1-identity. The underrepresentation of endogenous, class-specific ORs across evolutionarily distinct cell types in favor of the expression of the 5x21-OR1A1 transgene argues that a common mechanism of singular gene choice is present for all OR-expressing OSNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feature-space selection with banded ridge regression</a></h4>

              
                Encoding models provide a powerful framework to identify the information represented in brain recordings. In this framework, a stimulus representation is expressed as a feature space and is used in a regularized linear regression to predict brain activity. To account for a potential complementarity of different feature spaces, a joint model is fit on multiple feature spaces simultaneously. To adapt regularization strength to each feature space, ridge regression is extended to banded ridge regression, which optimizes a different regularization hyperparameter per feature space. The present paper proposes a method to decompose over feature spaces the variance explained by a banded ridge regression model. It also describes how banded ridge regression performs a feature-space selection, effectively ignoring non-predictive and redundant feature spaces. This feature-space selection leads to better prediction accuracy and to better interpretability. Banded ridge regression is then mathematically linked to a number of other regression methods with similar feature-space selection mechanisms. Finally, several methods are proposed to address the computational challenge of fitting banded ridge regressions on large numbers of voxels and feature spaces. All implementations are released in an open-source Python package called "Himalaya".

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-scanner brain MRI volumetric biases persist even in a harmonized multi-subject study of multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Background and Purpose: Multicenter designs involving a variety of MR imaging scanners have become increasingly common. These present the issue of biases in image-based measures due to scanner differences or site. To assess these biases, we imaged 11 volunteers with multiple sclerosis (MS) with scan and rescan data at 4 sites. Materials and Methods: Images were acquired on Siemens or Philips scanners at 3 tesla. Automated white matter lesion detection and whole brain, gray and white matter, and thalamic volumetry were performed, as well as expert manual delineations of T1 and T2 (FLAIR) lesions. Random effect and permutation-based nonparametric modeling was performed to assess differences in estimated volumes within and across sites. Results: Random effect modeling demonstrated model assumption violations for most comparisons of interest. Site explained > 50% of the variation in non-parametric modeling for most estimated volumes. This expanded to > 75% when data from both Siemens and Philips scanners were included. Permutation tests revealed significant differences between average inter- and intra-scanner differences in most estimated brain volumes (P < .05). The automatic activation of spine coil elements during some acquisitions resulted in a shading artifact in these images. Permutation tests revealed significant differences between thalamic volume measurements from acquisitions with and without this artifact. Conclusion: Differences in brain volumetry persisted across MR scanners despite protocol harmonization. These differences were not well explained by variance component modeling; however, statistical innovations for mitigating inter-scanner differences show promise in reducing biases in multi-center studies of MS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Manipulating the rapid consolidation periods in a learning task affects general skills more than statistical learning</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation processes have always been thought to cover up extended periods and have traditionally been investigated from the perspective of hours or days. However, the latest developments in memory research showed that memory stabilization processes could occur even within seconds. Here, we investigate this rapid form of consolidation during statistical learning. We aim to answer (a) whether this rapid offline improvement occurs in implicit statistical learning and general skill learning and (b) whether the duration of rest periods affects these two learning types differently. Participants performed a widely used statistical learning task - the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task - that enables us to measure implicit statistical and general skill learning separately. The ASRT task consisted of 25 learning blocks with a rest period between the blocks. In a between-subjects design, the length of the rest periods was fixed at 15 or 30 seconds, or the participants could control the length themselves. We found that the duration of rest periods does not affect the acquisition of statistical knowledge, but they do change the dynamics of learning in a way that learning is more likely to occur online in the case of certain fixed breaks. Moreover, we found weaker general skill learning in the self-paced group than in the fixed rest period groups (i.e., 15 and 30-second breaks). These results suggest that distinct learning processes are differently affected by the duration of short rest periods.

                Dystonia, a neurological disorder defined by abnormal postures and disorganised movements, is thought to be a neural circuit disorder with dysfunction arising within and between multiple brain regions. Given that spinal circuits are the de facto final common pathway for motor control, we sought to determine their contribution to the movement disorder. We confined a dystonia-related mutation to the spinal cord, which led to behavioural and physiological recapitulation of a severe form of inherited, early-onset, generalised dystonia. These data challenge our current understanding of dystonia, and lead to broader insights into spinal cord function and its involvement in movement disorder pathophysiology.

                During inflammatory, demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) axonal damage is prevalent early in the disease course. Axonal damage includes swellings, defects in transport, and failure to clear damaged intracellular proteins, all of which affect recovery and compromise the integrity of neurons and remyelination. Autophagy and the clearance of damaged cell components by the proteasome are important for the maintenance of normal cellular turnover; and the restoration of cellular homeostasis. The gradual accumulation of insoluble proteins in the brain is known to impair recovery from several neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify insoluble proteins within high-speed, mercaptoethanol/sarcosyl-insoluble pellets from purified white matter plaques isolated from the brains of individuals with MS. We determined that insoluble transmembrane protein106B (TMEM106B), expressed in neurons and glia and normally lysosomal-associated, is increased in MS plaques relative to normal-appearing white matter from individuals with Alzheimer disease and non-neurologic controls. We found that decreased TMEM106B protein in mice results in significant axonal damage and lipid droplet accumulation in the spinal cord following chronic myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. When TMEM106Bt/t mice were treated with cuprizone to experimentally induce demyelination, a significant increase in lipid deposition was observed in the corpus callosum of TMEM106Bt/t mice post-cuprizone withdrawal. Our study shows that the brain and spinal cord from challenged TMEM106Bt/t mice accumulate OilRedO+/Perilipin2+ lipid droplets. We postulate that increased insolubility of TMEM106B in MS plaques limits debris clearance by the lysosome which over time contributes to failed remyelination and axonal defects.

                Background and aims: Experiencing acute stress is common in behavioral addictions such as gambling disorder. Additionally, like most substance-induced addictions, aberrant decision-making wherein a reactive habit-induced response (conceptualized as a Model-free [MF] in reinforcement learning) suppresses a flexible goal-directed response (conceptualized as a Model-based [MB]) is also common in gambling disorder. In the current study we investigated the influence of acute stress on the balance between habitual response and the goal-directed system. Methods: A sample of N = 116 pathological gamblers (PG) and healthy controls (HC) performed an acute stress task - the Socially Evaluated Cold pressure task (SECPT) - or a control task. Self-reported stress and salivary cortisol were collected as measures of acute stress. Following the SECPT, participants performed the Two-Step Markov Task to account for the relative contribution of MB and MF strategies. Additionally, verbal working-memory and IQ measures were collected to account for their mediating effects on the orchestration between MB/MF and the impact of stress. Results: Both groups had comparable baseline and stress-induced cortisol response to the SECPT. Non-stressed PG displayed lower MB learning than HC. MANOVA and regression analyses showed a deleterious effect of stress-induced cortisol response on the orchestration between MB and MF learning in HC but not in PG. Neither working memory nor IQ mediated these effects. Discussion and Conclusions: Despite normal cortisol response to stress, we found an abnormal pattern of modulation of stress on the orchestration between MB and MF learning among PG.

                Cognitive acts take place over a large range of temporal scales. Numerous corresponding gradients in neurodynamic timescales and long-range cortical interactions are believed to provide organizational constraints to the brain and influence neural populations' roles in cognition. However, it is unclear if gradients in various types of neural timescales and functional connectivity arise from related or distinct neurophysiological processes and if they influence behavior. Here, intracranial recordings from 4,090 electrode contacts in 35 individuals were used to systematically map gradients of multiple aspects of neurodynamics, neural timescales, and functional connectivity, and assess their interactions along category-selective ventral temporal cortex. Opposing functional connectivity gradients, with decreasing connectivity to visually responsive regions and increasing connectivity to regions that were not visually responsive, were observed along the ventral visual hierarchy. Endogenous neural timescales were correlated with functional connectivity to visually responsive regions after removing the effects of shared anatomical gradients, suggesting that these properties influence one another. Different stimulus evoked and endogenous timescales exhibited gradients with longer dynamics along the ventral visual hierarchy, but none of these timescales were significantly correlated with one another. This suggests that local neural timescales depend on neural and cognitive context and different timescales may arise through distinct neurophysiological processes. Furthermore, activity from neural populations with faster endogenous timescales and stronger functional connectivity to visually responsive regions was more predictive of perceptual behavior during a visual repeat detection task. These results reveal interrelationships and key distinctions among neural timescale and functional connectivity gradients that together can influence behavior.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by progressive loss of motor neurons. Aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) within the central nerve system (CNS) is a pathological hallmark of sporadic ALS and prion-like propagation of pathogenic TDP-43 is thought to be implicated in disease progression. However, cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic TDP-43 in the human CNS has not been confirmed experimentally. Here we report that the administration of spinal cord extracts from an ALS patient induces the formation of TDP-43 pathology that progressively spreads in a time-dependent manner in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cerebral organoids. Pathogenic TDP-43 causes astrogliosis and cellular apoptosis, correlated with genomic damage due to DNA double-strand breaks. Thus, our results provide evidence that patient-derived pathogenic TDP-43 can mimic the prion-like propagation of TDP-43 pathology in human CNS tissue.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental dynamics of the postsynaptic proteome to understand synaptic maturation and dysmaturation</a></h4>

              
                The postsynaptic density (PSD) is a protein condensate composed of ~1,000 proteins beneath the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses. The number, shape, and plasticity of synapses are altered during development. However, the dynamics of synaptic protein composition across development have not been fully understood. Here we show alterations of PSD protein composition in mouse and primate brains during development. Proteins involved in synapse regulation are enriched in the differentially expressed (288 decreased and 267 increased) proteins on mouse PSD after a 2-week-old. We find that the changes in PSD protein abundance in mouse brains correlate with gene expression levels in postnatal mice and perinatal primates. This alteration of PSD composition is likely to be defective in the brains of mouse models or patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Finally, we demonstrate that the brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) changes PSD composition after the juvenile period. The alteration of PSD composition after 2-month-old is distinct from that observed in mice. Our results provide a comprehensive architecture of the remodeling of PSD composition across development, which may explain the molecular basics of synapse maturation and the pathology of psychiatric disorders, such as ASD.

                The representation of time in the brain is a fundamental component of cognition. Here we investigated how the human brain represents time during a temporally continuous uninterrupted experience by presenting fifteen neurosurgical patients with an audiovisual video while recording neurons' activity from multiple brain regions. We report on a set of units that modulate their activity in a strikingly periodic manner across different timescales--from seconds to many minutes. These cells were most prevalent in the entorhinal cortex and time could be decoded from their population activity. Furthermore, these cells remapped their dominant periodicity to shorter timescales during a subsequent recognition memory task. When the audiovisual sequence was presented at two different speeds (regular and faster), a significant percentage of these periodic time cells (PTCs) maintained their timescales, suggesting a degree of invariance with respect to the narrative content. The temporal periodicity of PTCs may complement the spatial periodicity of grid cells, thereby providing scalable spatiotemporal metrics for encoding and retrieval of human experience.

                The regulation of moment-to-moment neural variability may permit effective responses to changing cognitive demands. However, the mechanisms that support variability regulation are unknown. In the context of working memory, we leverage the largest available PET and fMRI dataset to jointly consider three lenses through which neural variability regulation could be understood: dopamine capacity, network-level functional integration, and flexible decision processes. We show that with greater working memory load, upregulation of variability was associated with elevated dopamine capacity and heightened functional integration, effects dominantly expressed in the striato-thalamic system rather than cortex. Strikingly, behavioral modeling revealed that working memory load evoked substantial decision biases during evidence accumulation, and those who jointly expressed a more optimal decision bias and higher dopamine capacity were most likely to upregulate striato-thalamic variability under load. We argue that the ability to align striato-thalamic variability to level of demand may be a hallmark of a well-functioning brain.

                Women are more vulnerable to internalizing disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety). This study took an integrative, developmental approach to investigate multidimensional factors associated with the emergence of sex differences in internalizing symptoms, using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Indices of sex hormone levels (dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone, and estradiol), physical pubertal development, task-based functional brain activity, family conflict, and internalizing symptoms were drawn from the ABCD study's baseline sample (9- to 10-year-old; N = 11,844). Principal component analysis served as a data-driven dimensionality reduction technique on the internalizing subscales to yield a single robust measure of internalizing symptoms. Moderated mediation analyses assessed whether associations between known risk factors and internalizing symptoms vary by sex. Results revealed direct and indirect effects of physical pubertal development on internalizing symptoms through family conflict across sexes. No effects were found of sex hormone levels or amygdala response to fearful faces on internalizing symptoms. Females did not report overall greater internalizing symptoms relative to males, suggesting that internalizing symptoms have not yet begun to increase in females at this age. Findings provide an essential baseline for future longitudinal research on the endocrine, neurocognitive, and psychosocial factors associated with sex differences in internalizing symptoms.

                Obesity-related pathologies and anorexia nervosa are increasingly considered as opposite ends of eating disorders (ED) spectrum. Accordingly, accumulating evidence points to opposite dysregulations of common brain systems in these pathologies, the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) in particular. However, to which extent alterations in NAc activity are sufficient to elicit ED-like behavioral dimensions remains to be established. Using acute, bidirectional, chemogenetic modulation of each NAc medium spiny neuron (MSN) subpopulation, we found that D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs oppositely regulate the balance between food intake and exercise-induced energy expenditure. As opposed to the limited effect of repeated chemogenetic manipulations of each MSN subpopulation, the concomitant manipulation of both MSN subpopulation had sustained effects. Repeated activation of D1-MSNs combined with repeated inhibition of D2-MSNs biased behavior toward activity-related energy expenditure leading to weight/fat loss, whilst the opposite manipulations favored energy intake and hence weight/fat gain. These results suggest that dysregulations of NAc dopaminoceptive MSN network might be at the core of EDs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical cue control of drug seeking in the face of cost</a></h4>

              
                Addiction is characterized by intermittent drug seeking despite rising costs. This behavior is heavily influenced by environmental stimuli that signal drug availability and reinforce seeking. We aimed to establish the relationship between three key aspects of human drug use in rats: the intermittent, binge nature of drug intake, the motivational conflict of drug seeking in the face of escalating negative costs, and the ability of different drug cues to interact to modulate relapse. Rats were trained to self administer cocaine on an intermittent access schedule, where brief drug availability states were signaled by a shift in the ambient lighting of the environment and cocaine delivery was signaled by a separate proximal cue. Rats then went through a conflict procedure, where foot shock intensity associated with cocaine seeking was escalated until intake was suppressed. We completed relapse tests where the drug delivery cue was non contingently presented alone, or in the context of dynamic drug availability state transitions. Intermittent access spurred psychomotor sensitization and binge-like cocaine intake. The intensity of binge-like drug taking during training was predictive of later drug seeking despite escalating costs. In relapse tests, the ability of a proximal drug cue to trigger relapse was gated by the presence of a global cue signaling drug-availability state transitions. Our results suggest that the pattern of drug intake plays a role in many features of addiction, including modifying an individual's willingness to endure high costs associated with drug seeking. Further, our results indicate that drug-related sensory information can be hierarchically organized to exert a dynamic modulating influence on drug-seeking motivation.

                The preBotzinger Complex (preBotC) of the lower brainstem generates two breathing-related rhythms: one for inspiration on a timescale of seconds and another that produces larger amplitude sighs on the order of minutes. Their underlying mechanisms and cellular origins remain incompletely understood. We resolve these problems via a joint experiment and modeling approach. Blocking purinergic gliotransmission does not perturb either rhythm and imaging experiments show that both rhythms emanate from the same glutamatergic neuron population. We hypothesized that these two disparate rhythms emerge in tandem wherein recurrent excitation gives rise to inspiratory rhythm while a calcium oscillator generates sighs; there is no obligatory role for gliotransmission, hyperpolarization activated mixed cationic current (Ih) in neurons, or synaptic inhibition-mediated coupling of separate populations. We developed a mathematical model that instantiates our working hypothesis. Tests of model predictions validate the single-population rhythmogenic framework, reproducing disparate breathing-related frequencies and the ability for inspiratory and sigh rhythms to be separately regulated in support of respiration under a wide array of conditions. Here we show how a single neuron population exploits two cellular tool-kits: one involving voltage-dependent membrane properties and synaptic excitation for inspiratory breathing (eupnea) and an intracellular biochemical oscillator for sighs, which ventilate and maintain optimal function in the compliant mammalian lung.

However, to date, how the brain makes sense of the higher-level semantic gist (topic keywords) of a continuous speech remains mysterious. Capitalizing on a generative probabilistic topic modelling algorithm on speech materials to which participants listened while their brain activities were recorded by Magnetoencephalography (MEG), here we show spatio-temporal neural representation of topic keywords in a multi-speaker environment where task-relevant (attended) and -irrelevant (unattended) speech co-exits. We report the difference of neural representation between salient and less salient semantic gist of both attended and unattended speech. Moreover, we show that greater sensitivity to semantically salient unattended speech in the left auditory and motor cortices negatively mediates attended speech comprehension.

                Motor variability is a fundamental feature of developing systems allowing motor exploration and learning. In human infants, leg movements involve a small number of basic coordination patterns called locomotor primitives, but whether and when motor variability could emerge from these primitives remains unknown. Here we longitudinally followed 10 neonates (~4 days old) until walking onset (~14 months old) and recorded the activity of their leg muscles during locomotor or rhythmic movements. Using unsupervised machine learning, we show that the structure of trial-to-trial variability changes during early development. In the neonatal period, infants own a minimal number of motor primitives but generate a maximal motor variability across trials thanks to variable activations of these primitives. A few months later, toddlers generate significantly less variability despite the existence of more primitives, due to more regularity within their activation. These results suggest that human neonates initiate motor exploration as soon as birth by variably activating a few basic locomotor primitives that later fraction and become more consistently activated by the motor system.

                Isoaspartate (isoAsp) is a damaging amino acid residue formed in proteins as a result of spontaneous deamidation. IsoAsp disrupts the secondary and higher order structures of proteins, damaging their functions and making them prone to aggregation. An association has been suggested between isoAsp and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Here we strengthened the link between isoAsp and AD by novel approaches to isoAsp analysis in blood human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant blood protein, a major carrier of amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptide and phosphorylated tau (pTau) protein in blood and a key participant in their clearance pathway. We discovered a reduced amount of anti-isoAsp antibodies (P < .0001), an elevated isoAsp level in HSA (P < .001), more HSA aggregates (P < .0001) and increased levels of free A{beta} (P < .01) in AD blood compared to healthy controls. We also found that deamidation significantly reduces HSA capacity to bind with A{beta} and pTau (P < .05). These findings support the presence in AD of a bottleneck in clearance of A{beta} and pTau leading to their increased concentrations in brain and facilitating their aggregations there.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel Computational Models of Evoked Dopamine Release In Vivo Measured by Fast Scan Cyclic Voltammetry Quantify the Regulation of Presynaptic Kinetics by Synucleins</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum is central to many normal and disease functions. Ventral midbrain dopamine neurons exhibit ongoing tonic firing that produce low extrasynaptic levels of dopamine below the detection of extrasynaptic electrochemical recordings (~10 - 20 nanomolar), with superimposed bursts that can saturate the dopamine uptake transporter and produce transient micromolar concentrations. The bursts have previously been shown to lead to presynaptic plasticity via multiple mechanisms, but analysis methods for these kinetic parameters are limited. To provide a deeper understanding of the mechanics of dopamine neurotransmission, we present three computational models of dopamine release with different levels of spatiotemporal complexity to analyze in vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry recordings from the dorsal striatum of mice. The models accurately fit to the cyclic voltammetry data and provide estimates of presynaptic dopamine facilitation/depression kinetics and dopamine transporter reuptake kinetics. We use the models to analyze the role of synuclein proteins in neurotransmission and quantify recent findings linking presynaptic protein -synuclein to the short-term facilitation and long-term depression of dopamine release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A parallel channel of state-dependent sensory signaling from the cholinergic basal forebrain to the auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) signaling exhibits multiple timescales of activity with classic, slow signals related to brain and behavioral states and faster, phasic signals reflecting behavioral events, including movement and reinforcement. Recent evidence suggests that the CBF may also exhibit fast, sensory-evoked responses. It remains unknown, however, whether such sensory signals target the sensory cortex and how they relate to local functional topography. Moreover, the extent to which fast and slow CBF activity interact has been largely unexplored. Here, we used simultaneous two-channel, two-photon imaging of CBF axons and auditory cortical (AC) neurons to reveal that CBF axons project a robust, non-habituating, and stimulus-specific sensory signal to the AC. Individual axon segments exhibited heterogeneous but stable tuning to auditory stimuli allowing stimulus identity to be decoded from the population. However, CBF axons displayed no tonotopy and their frequency tuning was uncoupled from that of nearby cortical neurons. Chemogenetic suppression revealed the auditory thalamus as a principal source of auditory information to the CBF. Finally, slow fluctuations in cholinergic activity modulated the fast, sensory-evoked signals in the same axons, suggesting that a multiplexed combination of fast and slow signals is projected from the CBF to the AC. Taken together, our work demonstrates a novel, non-canonical function of the CBF as a parallel channel of state-dependent sensory signaling to the sensory cortex that provides repeated representations of a broad range of sound stimuli at all points on the tonotopic map.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglial expression of the Wnt signalling modulator DKK2 differs between human Alzheimer's disease brains and mouse neurodegeneration models</a></h4>

              
                Wnt signalling is crucial for synapse and cognitive function. Indeed, deficient Wnt signalling is causally related to increased expression of DKK1, an endogenous negative Wnt regulator, and synapse loss, both of which likely contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasingly, AD research efforts have probed the neuroinflammatory role of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), which have furthermore been shown to be modulated by Wnt signalling. The DKK1 homologue DKK2 has been previously identified as an activated response and/or disease-associated microglia (DAM/ARM) gene in a mouse model of AD. Here we performed a detailed analysis of DKK2 in mouse models of neurodegeneration, and in human AD brain. In APP/PS1 and APPNL-G-F AD mouse model brains as well as in SOD1G93A ALS mouse model spinal cords, but not in control littermates, we demonstrated significant microgliosis and microglial Dkk2 mRNA upregulation in a disease-stage dependent manner. In the AD models, these DAM/ARM Dkk2+ microglia preferentially accumulated close to {beta}Amyloid plaques. Furthermore, recombinant DKK2 treatment of rat hippocampal primary neurons blocked WNT7a-induced dendritic spine and synapse formation, indicative of an anti-synaptic effect similar to that of DKK1. In stark contrast, no such microglial DKK2 upregulation was detected in the post-mortem human frontal cortex from individuals diagnosed with AD or pathological ageing. In summary, the difference in microglial expression of the DAM/ARM gene DKK2 between mouse models and human AD brain highlights the increasingly recognised limitations of using mouse models to recapitulate facets of human neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates for neonicotinoid-induced impairment of olfactory long-term memory</a></h4>

              
                Reports of olfactory learning and memory deficits in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoid pesticides have been accumulating over the past decades. As agonists of the nicotinic receptors to acetylcholine, neonicotinoids target most of the projection neurons conveying olfactory information to the memory brain centres, the mushroom bodies (MBs). However, the neural mechanisms by which neonicotinoids interfere with memory formation are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the consequences of chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on the number of projection neuron terminal boutons and on their plasticity in the context of long-term memory formation. Using super-resolution STED microscopy, we also measured the density of synapsin-positive units (SPUs) within boutons, as synapsin is known to be enriched in new boutons following neuronal activation. We show that imidacloprid suppresses the synaptic pruning of projection neurons naturally occurring with age and experience. The resulting excessive number of boutons in the MBs of treated bees was associated with long-term memory deficits. The subset of treated bees that showed successful memory formation had a similar number of boutons as untreated bees, suggesting that synaptic pruning might have been involved in the memorization process. As the SPU density was not affected by the imidacloprid treatment, the high bouton number in the lip of treated bees was not due to synaptogenesis. Altogether, our experiments show that, by altering synaptic pruning, imidacloprid interferes with long-term memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Common genetic variants in CHRNA5 alter β-amyloid neuropathology and highlight chandelier cells in human aging and Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Changes in high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are intricately connected to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While preclinical work suggests a possible protective and cognitive-enhancing role for the auxiliary nicotinic 5 subunit, mRNA expression of the CHRNA5 gene has not been closely examined in the context of human aging and dementia. Here, we investigate the impact of two common SNPs predicted to have different effects on the nicotinic 5 subunit: the function-compromising rs16969968 and the expression-altering rs1979905. We analyzed data from human prefrontal cortex (922 subjects with matched genotypic and post-mortem RNA sequencing, including 22 subjects with single-nucleus data) of elderly participants in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). We tested the impact of SNP haplotypes on prefrontal expression of CHRNA5 as well as that of SNPs in its receptor partners: CHRNA4 and CHRNB2. In the context of cognition and neuropathology, we observed a significant negative association between the high CHRNA5-expressing rs1979905A2 genotype and {beta}-amyloid load in the prefrontal cortex. Our analyses revealed that the greatest abundance of CHRNA5 expression was in chandelier neurons, a sparse but disproportionately-powerful set of interneurons, in addition to layer 5 and 6 pyramidal neurons. In subjects with functionally-unaltered CHRNA5, the proportion of chandelier cells in the prefrontal cortex shows resilience to {beta}-amyloid load, but this resilience is diminished in subjects homozygous for the minor allele of the CHRNA5 missense SNP rs16969968. Taken together, these findings urge further investigation into the role of CHRNA5 and chandelier cells in AD neuroprotection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Curation of BIDS (CuBIDS): a workflow and software package for streamlining reproducible curation of large BIDS datasets</a></h4>

              
                The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a specification accompanied by a software ecosystem that was designed to create reproducible and automated workflows for processing neuroimaging data. BIDS Apps flexibly build workflows based on the metadata detected in a dataset. However, even BIDS valid metadata can include incorrect values or omissions that result in inconsistent processing across sessions. Additionally, in large-scale, heterogeneous neuroimaging datasets, hidden variability in metadata is difficult to detect and classify. To address these challenges, we created a Python-based software package titled "Curation of BIDS" (CuBIDS), which provides an intuitive workflow that helps users validate and manage the curation of their neuroimaging datasets. CuBIDS includes a robust implementation of BIDS validation that scales to large samples and incorporates DataLad, a version control software package for data, to ensure reproducibility and provenance tracking throughout the entire curation process. CuBIDS provides tools to help users perform quality control on their images' metadata and identify unique combinations of imaging parameters. Users can then execute BIDS Apps on a subset of participants that represent the full range of acquisition parameters that are present, accelerating pipeline testing on large datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Paired stimulation for spike-timing dependent plasticity quantified with single neuron responses in primate motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is an extensively studied topic. Previous studies have demonstrated stimulus induced targeted STDP both in vitro and in vivo, but a more consistent and robust method is required. We hypothesized there were two reasons contributing to the inconsistent results previously reported: 1. the measure of connectivity is poorly understood, and 2. the timing of stimulation is static or has low temporal specificity. To test our hypotheses, we applied paired stimulation to the primary motor cortex of awake primates. Single unit responses to stimulation were used as measures of connectivity, and we applied inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) from +-0.1 to +-50 ms with sub-millisecond intervals. The excitatory single unit response resulted in very consistent changes after conditioning that was dependent on the ISI. Negative ISIs resulted in depression similar to classic STDP, but positive ISI also often resulted in depression. Normalizing the ISIs to the timing of the excitatory response revealed that potentiation only occurred if the second stimulus arrived before the response. Stimuli occurring around the time of the response often resulted in depression as strong as negative ISIs. We additionally tracked the changes in cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs), a commonly used measure of connectivity in plasticity experiments. CCEP changes showed a similar but more variable dependence to ISI. These results show that the classic STDP curve may be more difficult to induce due to interactions between excitatory and inhibitory circuitry, and that CCEPs may not be the ideal measure of changes in strength of connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early structural connectivity within the sensorimotor network: deviations related to prematurity and association to neurodevelopmental outcome</a></h4>

              
                The sensorimotor (SM) network is crucial for optimal neurodevelopment. However, undergoing rapid maturation during the perinatal period, it is particularly vulnerable to preterm birth. Our work explores the prematurity impact on the microstructure and maturation of primary SM white matter (WM) tracts at term-equivalent age (TEA) and evaluates the relationships between these alterations and neurodevelopmental outcome. We analyzed diffusion MRI data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) database: 59 preterm (PT) low-risk infants scanned near TEA, compared to a control group of full-term (FT) neonates paired for age at MRI and sex. We dissected pairwise connections between primary SM cortices and subcortical structures using probabilistic tractography and evaluated their microstructure with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) models. In addition to tract-specific univariate analyses of diffusion metrics, we computed a maturational distance related to prematurity based on a multi-parametric Mahalanobis distance of each PT infant relative to the FT group. Finally, we evaluated the relationships between this distance and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) scaled scores at 18 months corrected age. Our results confirm important microstructural differences in SM tracts between PT and FT infants, with effects increasing with lower gestational age at birth. Additionally, comparisons of maturational distances highlight that prematurity has a differential effect on SM tracts which follows the established WM caudo-rostral developmental pattern. Our results suggest a particular vulnerability of projections involving the primary sensorimotor cortices (S1) and of the most rostral tracts, with cortico-cortical and S1-Lenticular tracts presenting the highest alterations at TEA. Finally, NODDI-derived maturational distances of specific tracts seem related to fine motor and cognitive scores. This study expands the understanding of the impact of early WM alterations in the emerging SM network on long-term neurodevelopment. In the future, related approaches have potential to lead to the development of neuroimaging markers for neurodevelopmental disorders, with special interest for subtle neuromotor impairments frequently observed in preterm-born children.

                Affective disorders including depression (characterized by reduced motivation, social withdrawal and anhedonia), anxiety and irritability are frequently reported as long-term consequences of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)1 in addition to cognitive deficits, suggesting a possible dysregulation within mood/motivational neural circuits. One of the important brain regions that control motivation and mood is the lateral habenula (LHb) whose hyperactivity is associated with depression2. Here we used a repetitive closed head injury mTBI model that is associated with social deficits in adult male mice3 and explored the possible long-term alterations in LHb activity and motivated behavior 10-14 days post-injury. We found that mTBI increased the proportion of spontaneous tonically active LHb neurons while decreased LHb bursting. Additionally, mTBI diminished spontaneous glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic activity onto LHb neurons, while synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance was shifted toward excitation through a greater suppression of GABAergic transmission. Behaviorally, mTBI increased the latency in grooming behavior in sucrose splash test suggesting reduced self-care motivated behavior following mTBI. To show whether limiting LHb hyperactivity could restore motivational deficits in grooming behavior, we then tested the effects of Gi (hM4Di)-DREADD-mediated inhibition of LHb activity in sucrose splash test. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of LHb glutamatergic neurons was sufficient to reverse mTBI-induced delays in grooming behavior. Overall, our study provides the first evidence for persistent LHb neuronal dysfunction due to an altered synaptic integration as causal neural correlates of dysregulated motivational states by mTBI.

	<p>Chronic intermittent ethanol exposure during adolescence produces behavioral impairments and neurobiological changes that can last into young adulthood. One such behavioral impairment is reduced behavioral flexibility, a behavioral impairment that has been correlated with the risk for increased ethanol intake. In the current study, we investigated if chronic intermittent ethanol exposure during adolescence alters cognition, including behavioral flexibility, over a 22-month testing period. Female and male rats were treated with either 3.0 g/kg or 5.0 g/kg ethanol via gavage in a chronic intermittent fashion during adolescence and then tested every 4 to 5 months on a series of cognitive measures in the Morris water maze. Chronic intermittent ethanol selectively impaired behavioral flexibility in both female and male rats, although the pattern of results was different as a function of sex. In addition, female, but not male, rats were impaired in a short-term relearning test. Finally, male rats administered ethanol during adolescence were significantly more likely to not survive the 22-month experiment compared to female rats administered ethanol during adolescence. The current results demonstrate that adolescence is a unique period of development where chronic intermittent ethanol exposure produces long-lasting, selective cognitive impairments across the lifespan.</p>

	<p>Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a dermatological condition characterized by nodular hyperkeratotic lesions mainly on the legs and arms. Asymmetrical PN is a rare dermatological condition often associated with paralysis and stroke. In this paper, we present the case of a 77-year-old woman who developed post-ictal PN which responded to dupilumab, an anti-interleukin-4/13 drug approved for the management of AD, with an extreme reduction in itch sensation. Dupilumab and other therapies reducing Th2 inflammation may, in the future, become an alternative treatment for post-ictal pruritus/PN nonresponding to traditional therapies. Of course, larger studies will be necessary to confirm our case&amp;amp;rsquo;s findings.</p>

	<p>Intracranial aneurysms are pouch-like extrusions from the vessels at the base of the brain which can rupture and cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The pathophysiological mechanism of aneurysm formation is thought to be a consequence of blood flow (hemodynamic) induced changes on the endothelium. In this study, the results of a personalized aneurysm-on-a-chip model using patient-specific flow parameters and patient-specific cells are presented. CT imaging was used to calculate CFD parameters using an immersed boundary method. A microfluidic device either cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-EC) was used. Both types of endothelial cells were exposed for 24 h to either 0.03 Pa or 1.5 Pa shear stress, corresponding to regions of low shear and high shear in the computational aneurysm model, respectively. As a control, both cell types were also cultured under static conditions for 24 h as a control. Both HUVEC and hiPSC-EC cultures presented as confluent monolayers with no particular cell alignment in static or low shear conditions. Under high shear conditions HUVEC elongated and aligned in the direction of the flow. HiPSC-EC exhibited reduced cell numbers, monolayer gap formation and cells with aberrant, spread-out morphology. Future research should focus on hiPSC-EC stabilization to allow personalized intracranial aneurysm models.</p>

	<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has traditionally been evaluated and diagnosed via behavioral assessments. However, increasing research suggests that neuroimaging as early as infancy can reliably identify structural and functional differences between autistic and non-autistic brains. The current review provides a systematic overview of imaging approaches used to identify differences between infants at familial risk and without risk and predictive biomarkers. Two primary themes emerged after reviewing the literature: (1) neuroimaging methods can be used to describe structural and functional differences between infants at risk and infants not at risk for ASD (descriptive), and (2) neuroimaging approaches can be used to predict ASD diagnosis among high-risk infants and developmental outcomes beyond infancy (predicting later diagnosis). Combined, the articles highlighted that several neuroimaging studies have identified a variety of neuroanatomical and neurological differences between infants at high and low risk for ASD, and among those who later receive an ASD diagnosis. Incorporating neuroimaging into ASD evaluations alongside traditional behavioral assessments can provide individuals with earlier diagnosis and earlier access to supportive resources.</p>

	<p>Background: This study aimed to investigate the mediating effect of physical activity (PA) on the relationship between average sleep duration and risk of stroke in suburban residents without stroke. Methods: A cross-sectional study was executed, and participants were recruited through a multistage, stratified, probability-proportional-to-size sampling method in this research. The stroke risk was measured using a risk assessment form for a high-risk stroke population. The PA score was calculated by the Physical Activity Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3). The average sleep duration was calculated by adding up night sleep and afternoon nap durations. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to identify the association between stroke risk, average sleep duration, and PA. The direct and indirect effects of average sleep duration on stroke risk were analyzed by using the PA in a mediation framework. Results: A total of 5312 suburban residents (average: 54.96 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.21 years, 2970 women) participated in the study. After adjusting for covariates, relatively inappropriate sleep duration (&amp;amp;lt;7 h/&amp;amp;gt;8 h~9 h/&amp;amp;gt;9 h) and stroke risk were significantly associated, compared with the moderate average sleep duration (7~8 h) (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.038, 95% CI: 0.024~0.128; &amp;amp;beta; = 0.078, 95% CI: 0.128~0.250; &amp;amp;beta; = 0.150, 95% CI: 0.390~0.549). The PA total score (indirect effect ab = 0.013, 95% CI: 0.003~0.022) partially mediated the relationship between the long average sleep duration and stroke risk, in which the activity intensity (ab = &amp;amp;minus;0.015, 95% CI: &amp;amp;minus;0.021~&amp;amp;minus;0.008), the activity duration (ab = 0.043, 95% CI: 0.029~0.058), and the activity frequency (ab = 0.012, 95% CI: 0.004~0.020; ab = 0.037, 95% CI: 0.026~0.050) all played a mediating role in the different sleep duration. Conclusions: A significant relationship between a long average sleep duration and stroke risk factors among people without stroke was found in this study. The PA and its components partially mediated the association between a long average sleep duration and stroke risk. Suitable prevention methods and interventions for PA and sleep may reduce the risk of stroke.</p>

	<p>Background: This study examines the relationship between delusional severity in cognitively impaired adults with automatically computed volume and texture biomarkers from the Normal Appearing Brain Matter (NABM) in FLAIR MRI. Methods: Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 24) and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD, n = 18) with delusions of varying severities based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) (1&amp;amp;mdash;mild, 2&amp;amp;mdash;moderate, 3&amp;amp;mdash;severe) from the Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed for this task. The NABM region, which is gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) combined, was automatically segmented in FLAIR MRI volumes with intensity standardization and thresholding. Three imaging biomarkers were computed from this region, including NABM volume and two texture markers called &amp;amp;ldquo;Integrity&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Damage&amp;amp;rdquo;. Together, these imaging biomarkers quantify structural changes in brain volume, microstructural integrity and tissue damage. Multivariable regression was used to investigate relationships between imaging biomarkers and delusional severities (1, 2 and 3). Sex, age, education, APOE4 and baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau were included as co-variates. Results: Biomarkers were extracted from a total of 42 participants with longitudinal time points representing 164 imaging volumes. Significant associations were found for all three NABM biomarkers between delusion level 3 and level 1. Integrity was also sensitive enough to show differences between delusion level 1 and delusion level 2. A significant specified interaction was noted with severe delusions (level 3) and CSF tau for all imaging biomarkers (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). APOE4 homozygotes were also significantly related to the biomarkers. Conclusion: Cognitively impaired older adults with more severe delusions have greater global brain disease burden in the WM and GM combined (NABM) as measured using FLAIR MRI. Relative to patients with mild delusions, tissue degeneration in the NABM was more pronounced in subjects with higher delusional symptoms, with a significant association with CSF tau. Future studies are required to establish potential tau-associated mechanisms of increased delusional severity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Evolution Increases Primates Brain Complexity Extending RbFOX1 Splicing Activity to LSD1 Modulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent branching (100 MYA) of the mammalian evolutionary tree has enhanced brain complexity and functions at the putative cost of increased emotional circuitry vulnerability. Thus, to better understand psychopathology, a burden for the modern society, novel approaches should exploit evolutionary aspects of psychiatric-relevant molecular pathways. A handful of genes is nowadays tightly associated to psychiatric disorders. Among them, neuronal-enriched RbFOX1 modifies the activity of synaptic regulators in response to neuronal activity, keeping excitability within healthy domains. We here dissect a higher primates-restricted interaction between RbFOX1 and the transcriptional corepressor Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A). A single nucleotide variation (AA to AG) in <I>LSD1</I> gene appeared in higher primates and humans, endowing RbFOX1 with the ability to promote the alternative usage of a novel 3' AG splice site, which extends LSD1 exon E9 in the upstream intron (E9-long). Exon E9-long regulates LSD1 levels by Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay. As reintroduction of the archaic <I>LSD1</I> variant (AA) abolishes E9-long splicing, the novel 3' AG splice site is necessary for RbFOX1 to control LSD1 levels. LSD1 is a homeostatic immediate early genes (IEGs) regulator playing a relevant part in environmental stress-response. In primates and humans, inclusion of LSD1 as RbFOX1 target provides RbFOX1 with the additional ability to regulate the IEGs. These data, together with extensive RbFOX1 involvement in psychiatric disorders and its stress-dependent regulation in male mice, suggest the RbFOX1-LSD1-IEGs axis as an evolutionary recent psychiatric-relevant pathway. Notably, outside the nervous system, RbFOX2-dependent LSD1 modulation could be a candidate deregulated mechanism in cancer.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To be better understood, anxiety and depression need large human genetics studies aimed at further resolving the often ambiguous, aberrant neuronal pathomechanisms that impact corticolimbic circuitry physiology. Several genetic associations of the alternative splicing regulator RbFOX1 with psychiatric conditions suggest homeostatic unbalance as a neuronal signature of psychopathology. Here we move a step forward, characterizing a disease-relevant higher primates-specific pathway by which RbFOX1 acquires the ability to regulate neuronal levels of Lysine Specific Demethylase 1, an epigenetic modulator of environmental stress response. Thus, two brain-enriched enzymes, independently shown to homeostatically protect neurons with a clear readout in terms of emotional behavior in lower mammals, establish in higher primates and humans a new functional cooperation enhancing the complexity of environmental adaptation and stress vulnerability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Longitudinal Allometry of Sulcal Morphology in Health and Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scaling between subcomponents of folding and total brain volume (TBV) in healthy individuals (HIs) is allometric. It is unclear whether this is true in schizophrenia (SZ) or first-episode psychosis (FEP). This study confirmed normative allometric scaling norms in HIs using discovery and replication samples. Cross-sectional and longitudinal diagnostic differences in folding subcomponents were then assessed using an allometric framework. Structural imaging from a longitudinal (Sample 1: HI and SZ, n<SUB>HI Baseline</SUB> = 298, n<SUB>SZ Baseline</SUB> = 169, n<SUB>HI Follow-up</SUB> = 293, n<SUB>SZ Follow-up</SUB> = 168, totaling 1087 images, all individuals &ge; 2 images, age 16-69 years) and a cross-sectional sample (Sample 2: n<SUB>HI</SUB> = 61 and n<SUB>FEP</SUB> = 89, age 10-30 years), all human males and females, is leveraged to calculate global folding and its nested subcomponents: sulcation index (SI, total sulcal/cortical hull area) and determinants of sulcal area: sulcal length and sulcal depth. Scaling of SI, sulcal area, and sulcal length with TBV in SZ and FEP was allometric and did not differ from HIs. Longitudinal age trajectories demonstrated steeper loss of SI and sulcal area through adulthood in SZ. Longitudinal allometric analysis revealed that both annual change in SI and sulcal area was significantly stronger related to change in TBV in SZ compared with HIs. Our results detail the first evidence of the disproportionate contribution of changes in SI and sulcal area to TBV changes in SZ. Longitudinal allometric analysis of sulcal morphology provides deeper insight into lifespan trajectories of cortical folding in SZ.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Psychotic disorders are associated with deficits in cortical folding and brain size, but we lack knowledge of how these two morphometric features are related. We leverage cross-sectional and longitudinal samples in which we decompose folding into a set of nested subcomponents: sulcal and hull area, and sulcal depth and length. We reveal that, in both schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis, (1) scaling of subcomponents with brain size is different from expected scaling laws and (2) caution is warranted when interpreting results from traditional methods for brain size correction. Longitudinal allometric scaling points to loss of sulcal area as a principal contributor to loss of brain size in schizophrenia. These findings advance the understanding of cortical folding atypicalities in psychotic disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Critical Role for DLK and LZK in Axonal Repair in the Mammalian Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                <p>The limited ability for axonal repair after spinal cord injury underlies long-term functional impairment. Dual leucine-zipper kinase [DLK; MAP kinase kinase kinase 12; MAP3K12] is an evolutionarily conserved MAP3K implicated in neuronal injury signaling from <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> to mammals. However, whether DLK or its close homolog leucine zipper kinase (LZK; MAP3K13) regulates axonal repair in the mammalian spinal cord remains unknown. Here, we assess the role of endogenous DLK and LZK in the regeneration and compensatory sprouting of corticospinal tract (CST) axons in mice of both sexes with genetic analyses in a regeneration competent background provided by PTEN deletion. We found that inducible neuronal deletion of both DLK and LZK, but not either kinase alone, abolishes PTEN deletion-induced regeneration and sprouting of CST axons, and reduces naturally-occurring axon sprouting after injury. Thus, DLK/LZK-mediated injury signaling operates not only in injured neurons to regulate regeneration, but also unexpectedly in uninjured neurons to regulate sprouting. Deleting DLK and LZK does not interfere with PTEN/mTOR signaling, indicating that injury signaling and regenerative competence are independently controlled. Together with our previous study implicating LZK in astrocytic reactivity and scar formation, these data illustrate the multicellular function of this pair of MAP3Ks in both neurons and glia in the injury response of the mammalian spinal cord.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Functional recovery after spinal cord injury is limited because of a lack of axonal repair in the mammalian CNS. Dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK) and leucine zipper kinase (LZK) are two closely related protein kinases that have emerged as regulators of neuronal responses to injury. However, their role in axonal repair in the mammalian spinal cord has not been described. Here, we show that DLK and LZK together play critical roles in axonal repair in the mammalian spinal cord, validating them as potential targets to promote repair and recovery after spinal cord injury. In addition to regulating axonal regeneration from injured neurons, both kinases also regulate compensatory axonal growth from uninjured neurons, indicating a more pervasive role in CNS repair than originally anticipated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Columnar Localization and Laminar Origin of Cortical Surface Electrical Potentials</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electrocorticography (ECoG) methodologically bridges basic neuroscience and understanding of human brains in health and disease. However, the localization of ECoG signals across the surface of the brain and the spatial distribution of their generating neuronal sources are poorly understood. To address this gap, we recorded from rat auditory cortex using customized &mu;ECoG, and simulated cortical surface electrical potentials with a full-scale, biophysically detailed cortical column model. Experimentally, &mu;ECoG-derived auditory representations were tonotopically organized and signals were anisotropically localized to less than or equal to &plusmn;200 &mu;m, that is, a single cortical column. Biophysical simulations reproduce experimental findings and indicate that neurons in cortical layers V and VI contribute ~85% of evoked high-gamma signal recorded at the surface. Cell number and synchrony were the primary biophysical properties determining laminar contributions to evoked &mu;ECoG signals, whereas distance was only a minimal factor. Thus, evoked &mu;ECoG signals primarily originate from neurons in the infragranular layers of a single cortical column.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> ECoG methodologically bridges basic neuroscience and understanding of human brains in health and disease. However, the localization of ECoG signals across the surface of the brain and the spatial distribution of their generating neuronal sources are poorly understood. We investigated the localization and origins of sensory-evoked ECoG responses. We experimentally found that ECoG responses were anisotropically localized to a cortical column. Biophysically detailed simulations revealed that neurons in layers V and VI were the primary sources of evoked ECoG responses. These results indicate that evoked ECoG high-gamma responses are primarily generated by the population spike rate of pyramidal neurons in layers V and VI of single cortical columns and highlight the possibility of understanding how microscopic sources produce mesoscale signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tracing Modification to Cortical Circuits in Human and Nonhuman Primates from High-Resolution Tractography, Transcription, and Temporal Dimensions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neural circuits that support human cognition are a topic of enduring interest. Yet, there are limited tools available to map brain circuits in the human and nonhuman primate brain. We harnessed high-resolution diffusion MR tractography, anatomic, and transcriptomic data from individuals of either sex to investigate the evolution and development of frontal cortex circuitry. We applied machine learning to RNA sequencing data to find corresponding ages between humans and macaques and to compare the development of circuits across species. We transcriptionally defined neural circuits by testing for associations between gene expression and white matter maturation. We then considered transcriptional and structural growth to test whether frontal cortex circuit maturation is unusually extended in humans relative to other species. We also considered gene expression and high-resolution diffusion MR tractography of adult brains to test for cross-species variation in frontal cortex circuits. We found that frontal cortex circuitry development is extended in primates, and concomitant with an expansion in corticocortical pathways compared with mice in adulthood. Importantly, we found that these parameters varied relatively little across humans and studied primates. These data identify a surprising collection of conserved features in frontal cortex circuits across humans and Old World monkeys. Our work demonstrates that integrating transcriptional and structural data across temporal dimensions is a robust approach to trace the evolution of brain pathways in primates.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Diffusion MR tractography is an exciting method to explore pathways, but there are uncertainties in the accuracy of reconstructed tracts. We broaden the repertoire of toolkits to enhance our ability to trace human brain pathways from diffusion MR tractography. Our integrative approach finds corresponding ages across species and transcriptionally defines neural circuits. We used this information to test for variation in circuit maturation across species and found a surprising constellation of similar features in frontal cortex neural circuits across humans and primates. Integrating across scales of biological organization expands the repertoire of tools available to study pathways in primates, which opens new avenues to study pathways in health and diseases of the human brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Long-Term Inactivation of Sodium Channels as a Mechanism of Adaptation in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells function as place cells, increasing their firing rate when a specific place field is traversed. The dependence of CA1 place cell firing on position within the place field is asymmetric. We investigated the source of this asymmetry by injecting triangular depolarizing current ramps to approximate the spatially tuned, temporally diffuse depolarizing synaptic input received by these neurons while traversing a place field. Ramps were applied to CA1 pyramidal neurons from male rats <I>in vitro</I> (slice electrophysiology) and <I>in silico</I> (multicompartmental NEURON model). Under control conditions, CA1 neurons fired more action potentials at higher frequencies on the up-ramp versus the down-ramp. This effect was more pronounced for dendritic compared with somatic ramps. We incorporated a four-state Markov scheme for Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6 channels into our model and calibrated the spatial dependence of long-term inactivation according to the literature; this spatial dependence was sufficient to explain the difference in dendritic versus somatic ramps. Long-term inactivation reduced the firing frequency by decreasing open-state occupancy, and reduced spike amplitude during trains by decreasing occupancy in the closed state, which comprises the available pool. PKC activator phorbol-dibutyrate, known to reduce Na<SUB>V</SUB> long-term inactivation, removed spike amplitude attenuation <I>in vitro</I> more visibly in dendrites and greatly reduced adaptation, consistent with our hypothesized mechanism. Intracellular application of a peptide inducing long-term Na<SUB>V</SUB> inactivation elicited spike amplitude attenuation during spike trains in the soma and greatly enhanced adaptation. Our synergistic experimental/computational approach shows that long-term inactivation of Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6 is a key mechanism of adaptation in CA1 pyramidal cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The hippocampus plays an important role in certain types of memory, in part through context-specific firing of "place cells"; these cells were first identified in rodents as being particularly active when an animal is in a specific location in an environment, called the place field of that neuron. In this <I>in vitro</I>/<I>in silico</I> study, we found that long-term inactivation of sodium channels causes adaptation in the firing rate that could potentially skew the firing of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons earlier within a place field. A computational model of the sodium channel revealed differential regulation of spike frequency and amplitude by long-term inactivation, which may be a general mechanism for spike frequency adaptation in the CNS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Encoding of Environmental Cues in Central Amygdala Neurons during Foraging</a></h4>

              
                <p>To successfully forage in an environment filled with rewards and threats, animals need to rely on familiar structures of their environment that signal food availability. The central amygdala (CeA) is known to mediate a panoply of consummatory and defensive behaviors, yet how specific activity patterns within CeA subpopulations guide optimal choices is not completely understood. In a paradigm of appetitive conditioning in which mice freely forage for food across a continuum of cues, we found that two major subpopulations of CeA neurons, Somatostatin-positive (CeA<sup>Sst</sup>) and protein kinase C-positive (CeA<sup>PKC</sup>) neurons, can assign motivational properties to environmental cues. Although the proportion of food responsive cells was higher within CeA<sup>Sst</sup> than CeA<sup>PKC</sup> neurons, only the activities of CeA<sup>PKC</sup>, but not CeA<sup>Sst</sup>, neurons were required for learning of contextual food cues. Our findings point to a model in which CeA<sup>PKC</sup> neurons may incorporate stimulus salience together with sensory features of the environment to encode memory of the goal location.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The CeA has a very important role in the formation of memories that associate sensory information with aversive or rewarding representation. Here, we used a conditioned place preference paradigm, where freely moving mice learn to associate external cues with food availability, to investigate the roles of CeA neuron subpopulations. We found that CeA<sup>Sst</sup> and CeA<sup>PKC</sup> neurons encoded environmental cues during foraging but only the activities of CeA<sup>PKC</sup> neurons were required for learning of contextual food cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Variable Clock Underlies Internally Generated Hippocampal Sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans have the ability to store and retrieve memories with various degrees of specificity, and recent advances in reinforcement learning have identified benefits to learning when past experience is represented at different levels of temporal abstraction. How this flexibility might be implemented in the brain remains unclear. We analyzed the temporal organization of male rat hippocampal population spiking to identify potential substrates for temporally flexible representations. We examined activity both during locomotion and during memory-associated population events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). We found that spiking during SWRs is rhythmically organized with higher event-to-event variability than spiking during locomotion-associated population events. Decoding analyses using clusterless methods further indicate that a similar spatial experience can be replayed in multiple SWRs, each time with a different rhythmic structure whose periodicity is sampled from a log-normal distribution. This variability increases with experience despite the decline in SWR rates that occurs as environments become more familiar. We hypothesize that the variability in temporal organization of hippocampal spiking provides a mechanism for storing experiences with various degrees of specificity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> One of the most remarkable properties of memory is its flexibility: the brain can retrieve stored representations at varying levels of detail where, for example, we can begin with a memory of an entire extended event and then zoom in on a particular episode. The neural mechanisms that support this flexibility are not understood. Here we show that hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, which mark the times of memory replay and are important for memory storage, have a highly variable temporal structure that is well suited to support the storage of memories at different levels of detail.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortico-Striatal Control over Adaptive Goal-Directed Responding Elicited by Cues Signaling Sucrose Reward or Punishment</a></h4>

              
                <p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been associated with the expression of adaptive and maladaptive behavior elicited by fear-related and drug-associated cues. However, reported effects of mPFC manipulations on cue-elicited natural reward-seeking and inhibition thereof have been varied, with few studies examining cortico-striatal contributions in tasks that require adaptive responding to cues signaling reward and punishment within the same session. The current study aimed to better elucidate the role of mPFC and NAc subdivisions, and their functional connectivity in cue-elicited adaptive responding using a novel discriminative cue responding task. Male Long&ndash;Evans rats learned to lever-press on a VR5 schedule for a discriminative cue signaling reward, and to avoid pressing the same lever in the presence of another cue signaling punishment. Postacquisition, prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) areas of the mPFC, NAc core, shell, PL-core, or IL-shell circuits were pharmacologically or chemogenetically inhibited while animals performed under (1) nonreinforced (extinction) conditions, where the appetitive and aversive cues were presented in alternating trials alone or as a compound stimulus; and (2) reinforced conditions, whereby cued responding was accompanied by associated outcomes. PL and IL inactivation attenuated nonreinforced and reinforced goal-directed cue responding, whereas NAc core and shell inactivation impaired nonreinforced responding for the appetitive, but not aversive cue. Furthermore, PL-core and IL-shell inhibition disinhibited nonreinforced but not reinforced cue responding. Our findings implicate the mPFC as a site of confluence of motivationally significant cues and outcomes, and in the regulation of nonreinforced cue responding via downstream NAc targets.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to discriminate and respond appropriately to environmental cues that signal availability of reward or punishment is essential for survival. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been implicated in adaptive and maladaptive behavior elicited by fear-related and drug-associated cues. However, less is known about the role they play in orchestrating adaptive responses to natural reward and punishment cues within the same behavioral task. Here, using a novel discriminative cue responding task combined with pharmacological or chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC, NAc and mPFC-NAc circuits, we report that mPFC is critically involved in responding to changing cued response-outcomes, both when the responses are reinforced, and nonreinforced. Furthermore, the mPFC coordinates nonreinforced discriminative cue responding by suppressing inappropriate responding via downstream NAc targets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cross-Frequency Brain Network Dynamics Support Pitch Change Detection</a></h4>

              
                <p>Processing auditory sequences involves multiple brain networks and is crucial to complex perception associated with music appreciation and speech comprehension. We used time-resolved cortical imaging in a pitch change detection task to detail the underlying nature of human brain network activity, at the rapid time scales of neurophysiology. In response to tone sequence presentation to the participants, we observed slow inter-regional signaling at the pace of tone presentations (2-4 Hz) that was directed from auditory cortex toward both inferior frontal and motor cortices. Symmetrically, motor cortex manifested directed influence onto auditory and inferior frontal cortices via bursts of faster (15-35 Hz) activity. These bursts occurred precisely at the expected latencies of each tone in a sequence. This expression of interdependency between slow/fast neurophysiological activity yielded a form of local cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling in auditory cortex, which strength varied dynamically and peaked when pitch changes were anticipated. We clarified the mechanistic relevance of these observations in relation to behavior by including a group of individuals afflicted by congenital amusia, as a model of altered function in processing sound sequences. In amusia, we found a depression of inter-regional slow signaling toward motor and inferior frontal cortices, and a chronic overexpression of slow/fast phase-amplitude coupling in auditory cortex. These observations are compatible with a misalignment between the respective neurophysiological mechanisms of stimulus encoding and internal predictive signaling, which was absent in controls. In summary, our study provides a functional and mechanistic account of neurophysiological activity for predictive, sequential timing of auditory inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Auditory sequences are processed by extensive brain networks, involving multiple systems. In particular, fronto-temporal brain connections participate in the encoding of sequential auditory events, but so far, their study was limited to static depictions. This study details the nature of oscillatory brain activity involved in these inter-regional interactions in human participants. It demonstrates how directed, polyrhythmic oscillatory interactions between auditory and motor cortical regions provide a functional account for predictive timing of incoming items in an auditory sequence. In addition, we show the functional relevance of these observations in relation to behavior, with data from both normal hearing participants and a rare cohort of individuals afflicted by congenital amusia, which we considered here as a model of altered function in processing sound sequences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spectral Fingerprints of Cortical Neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pupil size has been established as a versatile marker of noradrenergic and cholinergic neuromodulation, which has profound effects on neuronal processing, cognition, and behavior. However, little is known about the cortical control and effects of pupil-linked neuromodulation. Here, we show that pupil dynamics are tightly coupled to temporally, spectrally, and spatially specific modulations of local and large-scale cortical population activity in the human brain. We quantified the dynamics of band-limited cortical population activity in resting human subjects using magnetoencephalography and investigated how neural dynamics were linked to simultaneously recorded pupil dynamics. Our results show that pupil-linked neuromodulation does not merely affect cortical population activity in a stereotypical fashion. Instead, we identified three frontal, precentral, and occipitoparietal networks, in which local population activity with distinct spectral profiles in the theta, beta, and alpha bands temporally preceded and followed changes in pupil size. Furthermore, we found that amplitude coupling at ~16 Hz in a large-scale frontoparietal network predicted pupil dynamics. Our results unravel network-specific spectral fingerprints of cortical neuromodulation in the human brain that likely reflect both the causes and effects of neuromodulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain function is constantly affected by modulatory neurotransmitters. Pupil size has been established as a versatile marker of noradrenergic and cholinergic neuromodulation. However, because the cortical correlates of pupil dynamics are largely unknown, fundamental questions remain unresolved. Which cortical networks control pupil-linked neuromodulation? Does neuromodulation affect cortical activity in a stereotypical or region-specific fashion? To address this, we quantified the dynamics of cortical population activity in human subjects using magnetoencephalography. We found that pupil dynamics are coupled to highly specific modulations of local and large-scale cortical activity in the human brain. We identified four cortical networks with distinct spectral profiles that temporally predicted and followed pupil size dynamics. These effects likely reflect both the cortical control and effect of neuromodulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mixed Selectivity in the Cerebellar Purkinje-Cell Response during Visuomotor Association Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although the cerebellum has been traditionally considered to be exclusively involved in motor control, recent anatomic and clinical studies show that it also has a role in reward-processing. However, the way in which the movement-related and the reward-related neural activity interact at the level of the cerebellar cortex and contribute toward learning is still unclear. Here, we studied the simple spike activity of Purkinje cells in the mid-lateral cerebellum when 2 male monkeys learned to associate a right or left-hand movement with one of two visual symbolic cues. These cells had distinctly different discharge patterns between an overtrained symbol&ndash;hand association and a novel symbol&ndash;hand association, responding in association with the movement of both hands, although the kinematics of the movement did not change between the two conditions. The activity change was not related to the pattern of the visual symbols, the movement kinematics, the monkeys' reaction times, or the novelty of the visual symbols. The simple spike activity changed throughout the learning process, but the concurrent complex spikes did not instruct that change. Although these neurons also have reward-related activity, the reward-related and movement-related signals were independent. We suggest that this mixed selectivity may facilitate the flexible learning of difficult reinforcement learning problems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebellum receives both motor-related and reward-related information. However, it is unclear how these two signals interact at the level of cerebellar cortex and contribute to learning nonmotor skills. Here we show that in the mid-lateral cerebellum, the reward information is encoded independently from the motor information such that during reward-based learning, only the reward information carried by the Purkinje cells inform learning while the motor information remains unchanged with learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Consolidation of Sleep-Dependent Appetitive Memory Is Mediated by a Sweet-Sensing Circuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sleep is a universally conserved physiological state which contributes toward basic organismal functions, including cognitive operations such as learning and memory. Intriguingly, organisms can sometimes form memory even without sleep, such that <I>Drosophila</I> display sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory in an olfactory appetitive training paradigm. Sleep-dependent memory can be elicited by the perception of sweet taste, and we now show that a mixed-sex population of flies maintained on sorbitol, a tasteless but nutritive substance, do not require sleep for memory consolidation. Consistent with this, silencing sugar-sensing gustatory receptor neurons in fed flies triggers a switch to sleep-independent memory consolidation, whereas activating sugar-sensing gustatory receptor neurons results in the formation of sleep-dependent memory in starved flies. Sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory relies on distinct subsets of reward signaling protocerebral anterior medial dopaminergic neurons (PAM DANs) such that PAM-&beta;'2mp DANs mediate memory in fed flies whereas PAM-&alpha;1 DANs are required in starved flies. Correspondingly, we observed a feeding-dependent calcium increase in PAM-&beta;'2mp DANs, but not in PAM-&alpha;1 DANs. Following training, the presence of sweet sugars recruits PAM-&beta;'2mp DANs, whereas tasteless medium increases calcium in PAM-&alpha;1 DANs. Together, this work identifies mechanistic underpinnings of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, in particular demonstrating a role for the processing of sweet taste reward signals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sleep is essential for encoding and consolidating memories, but animals must often suppress sleep for survival. Consequently, <I>Drosophila</I> have evolved sleep-independent consolidation that allows retention of essential information without sleep. In the presence of food, sleep is required for memory, but mechanisms that transmit signals from food cues to regulate the need for sleep in memory are largely unknown. We found that sweet-sensing neurons drive the recruitment of specific reward signaling dopaminergic neurons to establish sleep-dependent memory. Conversely, in the absence of a sweet stimulus, different neurons are activated within the same dopaminergic cluster for sleep-independent memory consolidation. Therefore, the processing of sleep-dependent memory relies on the presence of sweet sugars that signal through reward circuitry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Divergent Histopathological Networks of Frontotemporal Degeneration Proteinopathy Subytpes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Network analyses inform complex systems such as human brain connectivity, but this approach is seldom applied to gold-standard histopathology. Here, we use two complimentary computational approaches to model microscopic progression of the main subtypes of tauopathy versus TDP-43 proteinopathy in the human brain. Digital histopathology measures were obtained in up to 13 gray matter (GM) and adjacent white matter (WM) cortical brain regions sampled from 53 tauopathy and 66 TDP-43 proteinopathy autopsy patients. First, we constructed a weighted non-directed graph for each group, where nodes are defined as GM and WM regions sampled and edges in the graph are weighted using the group-level Pearson's correlation coefficient for each pairwise node comparison. Additionally, we performed mediation analyses to test mediation effects of WM pathology between anterior frontotemporal and posterior parietal GM nodes. We find greater correlation (i.e., edges) between GM and WM node pairs in tauopathies compared with TDP-43 proteinopathies. Moreover, WM pathology strongly correlated with a graph metric of pathology spread (i.e., node-strength) in tauopathies (<I>r</I> = 0.60, <I>p</I> &lt; 0.03) but not in TDP-43 proteinopathies (<I>r</I> = 0.03, <I>p</I> = 0.9). Finally, we found mediation effects for WM pathology on the association between anterior and posterior GM pathology in FTLD-Tau but not in FTLD-TDP. These data suggest distinct tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies may have divergent patterns of cellular propagation in GM and WM. More specifically, axonal spread may be more influential in FTLD-Tau progression. Network analyses of digital histopathological measurements can inform models of disease progression of cellular degeneration in the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we uniquely perform two complimentary computational approaches to model and contrast microscopic disease progression between common frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) proteinopathy subtypes with similar clinical syndromes during life. Our models suggest white matter (WM) pathology influences cortical spread of disease in tauopathies that is less evident in TDP-43 proteinopathies. These data support the hypothesis that there are neuropathologic signatures of cellular degeneration within neurocognitive networks for specific protienopathies. These distinctive patterns of cellular pathology can guide future efforts to develop tissue-sensitive imaging and biological markers with diagnostic and prognostic utility for FTLD. Moreover, our novel computational approach can be used in future work to model various neurodegenerative disorders with mixed proteinopathy within the human brain connectome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Informative prior on structural equation modelling with non-homogenous error structure [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: This study investigates the impact of informative prior on Bayesian structural equation model (BSEM) with heteroscedastic error structure. A major drawback of homogeneous error structure is that, in most studies the underlying assumption of equal variance across observation is often unrealistic, hence the need to consider the non-homogenous error structure. Methods: Updating appropriate informative prior, four different forms of heteroscedastic error structures were considered at sample sizes 50, 100, 200 and 500. Results: The results show that both posterior predictive probability (PPP) and log likelihood are influenced by the sample size and the prior information, hence the model with the linear form of error structure is the best. Conclusions: The study has been able to address sufficiently the problem of heteroscedasticity of known form using four different heteroscedastic conditions, the linear form outperformed other forms of heteroscedastic error structure thus can accommodate any form of data that violates the homogenous variance assumption by updating appropriate informative prior. Thus, this approach provides an alternative approach to the existing classical method which depends solely on the sample information.

                Background: Ayres Sensory Integration (ASI) is widely employed by occupational therapists working with clients who experience challenges in sensory integration, including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there is a dearth of research examining the feasibility of ASI outside of Western nations. This study documented the barriers associated with ASI in Saudi Arabia and assessed whether the intervention could improve process and participation skills. Methods: Single-Subject experimental design was used. The participant was a 4-year-old girl with ASD from Saudi Arabia. Data were gathered on sensory processing, motor skills, and participation in activities of daily living. The study used semi-structured interviews and assessments (Sensory Integration and Praxis Tests, the Sensory Processing Measure-Preschool, and the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale-2) to develop goals, identify outcome measures, and plan an ASI intervention. Results: Despite the limited availability of resources (e.g., toys, treatment spaces) and Arabic measures, improvements were observed on motor and sensory tasks and in occupational performance. Conclusion: ASI that adheres to the ASI fidelity tool can be of value for Saudi Arabian children with ASD. Additionally, the study provides a stepping-stone to further research for occupational therapists in Saudi Arabia working with children with ASD.

                Synthetic lethal interactions (SLIs), genetic interactions in which the simultaneous inactivation of two genes leads to a lethal phenotype, are promising targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer, as exemplified by the recent success of PARP inhibitors in treating BRCA1/2-deficient tumors. We present SL-Cloud, a new component of the Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Gateway in the Cloud (ISB-CGC), that provides an integrated framework of cloud-hosted data resources and curated workflows to enable facile prediction of SLIs. This resource addresses two main challenges related to SLI inference: the need to wrangle and preprocess large multi-omic datasets and the availability of multiple comparable prediction approaches. SL-Cloud enables customizable computational inference of SLIs and testing of prediction approaches across multiple datasets. We anticipate that cancer researchers will find utility in this tool for discovery of SLIs to support further investigation into potential drug targets for anticancer therapies.

                <p>by Alessio Gravina, Jennifer L. Wilson, Davide Bacciu, Kevin J. Grimes, Corrado Priami</p>

Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder, leading to both physical and social morbidity. Worldwide 1% of the population is struggling with the disease, with 100,000 new cases annually only in the United States. Despite its importance, the goal of finding effective treatments for schizophrenia remains a challenging task, and previous work conducted expensive large-scale phenotypic screens. This work investigates the benefits of Machine Learning for graphs to optimize drug phenotypic screens and predict compounds that mitigate abnormal brain reduction induced by excessive glial phagocytic activity in schizophrenia subjects. Given a compound and its concentration as input, we propose a method that predicts a score associated with three possible compound effects, i.e., reduce, increase, or not influence phagocytosis. We leverage a high-throughput screening to prove experimentally that our method achieves good generalization capabilities. The screening involves 2218 compounds at five different concentrations. Then, we analyze the usability of our approach in a practical setting, i.e., prioritizing the selection of compounds in the SWEETLEAD library. We provide a list of 64 compounds from the library that have the most potential clinical utility for glial phagocytosis mitigation. Lastly, we propose a novel approach to computationally validate their utility as possible therapies for schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Mechanistic basis for multidrug resistance and collateral drug sensitivity conferred to the malaria parasite by polymorphisms in PfMDR1 and PfCRT</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah Heckmatt Shafik, Sashika Natasha Richards, Ben Corry, Rowena Elizabeth Martin</p>

Polymorphisms in the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> multidrug resistance protein 1 (<i>pfmdr1</i>) gene and the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> chloroquine resistance transporter (<i>pfcrt</i>) gene alter the malaria parasite’s susceptibility to most of the current antimalarial drugs. However, the precise mechanisms by which PfMDR1 contributes to multidrug resistance have not yet been fully elucidated, nor is it understood why polymorphisms in <i>pfmdr1</i> and <i>pfcrt</i> that cause chloroquine resistance simultaneously increase the parasite’s susceptibility to lumefantrine and mefloquine—a phenomenon known as collateral drug sensitivity. Here, we present a robust expression system for PfMDR1 in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes that enables direct and high-resolution biochemical characterizations of the protein. We show that wild-type PfMDR1 transports diverse pharmacons, including lumefantrine, mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin, piperaquine, amodiaquine, methylene blue, and chloroquine (but not the antiviral drug amantadine). Field-derived mutant isoforms of PfMDR1 differ from the wild-type protein, and each other, in their capacities to transport these drugs, indicating that PfMDR1-induced changes in the distribution of drugs between the parasite’s digestive vacuole (DV) and the cytosol are a key driver of both antimalarial resistance and the variability between multidrug resistance phenotypes. Of note, the PfMDR1 isoforms prevalent in chloroquine-resistant isolates exhibit reduced capacities for chloroquine, lumefantrine, and mefloquine transport. We observe the opposite relationship between chloroquine resistance-conferring mutations in PfCRT and drug transport activity. Using our established assays for characterizing PfCRT in the <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte system and in live parasite assays, we demonstrate that these PfCRT isoforms transport all 3 drugs, whereas wild-type PfCRT does not. We present a mechanistic model for collateral drug sensitivity in which mutant isoforms of PfMDR1 and PfCRT cause chloroquine, lumefantrine, and mefloquine to remain in the cytosol instead of sequestering within the DV. This change in drug distribution increases the access of lumefantrine and mefloquine to their primary targets (thought to be located outside of the DV), while simultaneously decreasing chloroquine’s access to its target within the DV. The mechanistic insights presented here provide a basis for developing approaches that extend the useful life span of antimalarials by exploiting the opposing selection forces they exert upon PfCRT and PfMDR1.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to identify predictors in common between different clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing predictive models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 704 patients from our center seen at MS onset, measuring 37 baseline demographic, clinical, treatment, and MRI predictors, and 10-year outcomes. Our primary aim was identifying predictors in common among clinical outcomes: aggressive MS, benign MS, and secondary-progressive (SP)MS. We also investigated MRI outcomes: T2 lesion volume (T2LV) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). The performance of the full 37-predictor model was compared with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-selected model of predictors in common between each outcome by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The full 37-predictor model was highly predictive of clinical outcomes: in-sample AUC was 0.91 for aggressive MS, 0.81 for benign MS, and 0.81 for SPMS. After variable selection, 10 LASSO-selected predictors were in common between each clinical outcome: age, Expanded Disability Status Scale, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory and bowel/bladder signs, timed 25-foot walk ≥6 seconds, poor attack recovery, no sensory attacks, and time-to-treatment. This reduced model had comparable cross-validation AUC as the full 37-predictor model: 0.84 versus 0.81 for aggressive MS, 0.75 versus 0.73 for benign MS, and 0.76 versus 0.75 for SPMS, respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Coastal South India: A 8-year retrospective study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare, benign condition of unknown etiology, presenting as cervical lymphadenitis. Lymphadenopathy is usually tender and maybe associated with systemic symptoms. Despite the extensive literature on this disease, it continues to be misdiagnosed owing to its misleading clinical presentation. Methods: A retrospective hospital-based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in tertiary care hospitals from 2011 to 2019. All patients with confirmed KFD diagnosis were included and after ethics committee approval the clinical details and histopathological data was retrieved from the medical records department and analyzed. Results: A total of 67 cases were included. The mean age was 26.9±11.3 years with a female: male ratio of 1.9:1. There were 50 patients with tender cervical lymphadenopathy which was the most common clinical presentation. The mean length and width of palpable lymph nodes were 2.3±1.0 cm and 2.2±0.7 cm respectively. Histology revealed proliferative stage in majority of patients (n=40, 59.7%). Lymphadenopathy resolved in 83.6% within 2 months. There were 42 patients who had complete recovery with symptomatic treatment within a period of 9 months. Conclusions: KFD is prevalent in young, female patients of Asian descent and often presents as tender cervical lymphadenopathy. Early diagnosis with excisional lymph node biopsy is crucial to avoid unnecessary investigations and treatment. Treatment is symptomatic unless complicated, where steroid therapy is considered. KFD has an excellent prognosis with almost no risk of fatality.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of endovascular therapy (EVT) versus intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO), based on the information of advanced imaging.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data of stroke patients with radiologically confirmed BAO within 24 hours. BAO subjects were categorized into “top-of-the-basilar” syndrome (TOBS) and other types. An initial infarct size of &lt;70ml and a ratio of ischemic tissue to infarct volume of ≥1.8 was defined as “target mismatch.” The primary outcome was a good outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3 at 3 months. Propensity score adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity score methods were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 474 BAO patients, 93 (19.6%) were treated with IVT prior to EVT, 91 (19.2%) were treated with IVT alone, 95 (20.0%) were treated with EVT alone, and 195 (41.1%) were treated with antithrombotic therapy. In IPTW analyses, we found no benefit of EVT over IVT for good outcome in either TOBS patients (odds ratio = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88–1.31) or those with other types (odds ratio = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.94–1.36). However, in patients with other types, if there existed a target mismatch, EVT was independently related to good outcome (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.17–1.81).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The “target mismatch profile” seems to be a possible candidate selection standard of EVT for those with other types of BAO. Future studies should separate TOBS from other types of BAO, and try to use advanced imaging. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Introduction: In the COVID-19 context, university teachers have had to face the most complex educational demands, psychosocial risks, and the anxiety of responding to limitations in terms of connectivity and fulfillment of academic objectives. To identify the levels of Burnout and anxiety in the COVID-19 context and determine how these levels are manifested in the participating teachers. Methods: This was an analytical non-experimental, cross-sectional study. The population was 150 teachers of the Human Medicine Program of the University of San Martín de Porres, Chiclayo, Peru, and the sample was 66 teachers. The survey consisted of three sections: 1. Informed consent, 2. Maslach's Burnout Inventory, 3. Beck's Anxiety Inventory. Data processing was performed using the SPSS V.27 statistical software and all citations and bibliographical references were processed using Mendeley Desktop 1.19.8. Results: In the variable burnout syndrome, 25% of the participants were in the high level downwards; they present anxiety in 30.30% of the total. It was found that 50% of teachers presented mild to moderate anxiety. Conclusions: the largest number of teachers surveyed present anxiety due to burnout syndrome in the COVID-19 context. Finally, it is found that there is a correlation between anxiety and the sociodemographic variables sex, age, and marital status.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bayesian inference of kinetic schemes for ion channels by Kalman filtering</a></h4>

              
                Inferring adequate kinetic schemes for ion channel gating from ensemble currents is a daunting task due to limited information in the data. We address this problem by using a parallelized Bayesian filter to specify hidden Markov models for current and fluorescence data. We demonstrate the flexibility of this algorithm by including different noise distributions. Our generalized Kalman filter outperforms both a classical Kalman filter and a rate equation approach when applied to patch-clamp data exhibiting realistic open-channel noise. The derived generalization also enables inclusion of orthogonal fluorescence data, making unidentifiable parameters identifiable and increasing the accuracy of the parameter estimates by an order of magnitude. By using Bayesian highest credibility volumes, we found that our approach, in contrast to the rate equation approach, yields a realistic uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the Bayesian filter delivers negligibly biased estimates for a wider range of data quality. For some data sets it identifies more parameters than the rate equation approach. These results also demonstrate the power of assessing the validity of algorithms by Bayesian credibility volumes in general. Finally, we show that our Bayesian filter is more robust against errors induced by either analog filtering before analog-to-digital conversion or by limited time resolution of fluorescence data than a rate equation approach.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A discrete parasubthalamic nucleus subpopulation plays a critical role in appetite suppression</a></h4>

              
                Food intake behavior is regulated by a network of appetite-inducing and appetite-suppressing neuronal populations throughout the brain. The parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), a relatively unexplored population of neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, has been hypothesized to regulate appetite due to its connectivity with other anorexigenic neuronal populations and because these neurons express Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, following a meal. However, the individual cell types that make up the PSTN are not well characterized, nor are their functional roles in food intake behavior. Here we identify and distinguish between two discrete PSTN subpopulations, those that express tachykinin-1 (PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons) and those that express corticotropin-releasing hormone (PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons), and use a panel of genetically encoded tools in mice to show that PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons play an important role in appetite suppression. Both subpopulations increase activity following a meal and in response to administration of the anorexigenic hormones amylin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY). Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup>, but not PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons, reduces the appetite-suppressing effects of these hormones. Consistently, optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons, but not PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons, reduces food intake in hungry mice. PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> and PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons project to distinct downstream brain regions, and stimulation of PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> projections to individual anorexigenic populations reduces food consumption. Taken together, these results reveal the functional properties and projection patterns of distinct PSTN cell types and demonstrate an anorexigenic role for PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons in the hormonal and central regulation of appetite.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intrinsic excitability mechanisms of neuronal ensemble formation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal ensembles are coactive groups of cortical neurons, found in spontaneous and evoked activity, that can mediate perception and behavior. To understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of ensembles, we co-activated layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from mouse visual cortex, in animals of both sexes, replicating <i>in vitro</i> an optogenetic protocol to generate ensembles <i>in vivo</i>. Using whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp pair recordings we find that, after optogenetic or electrical stimulation, coactivated neurons increase their correlated activity, a hallmark of ensemble formation. Coactivated neurons showed small biphasic changes in presynaptic plasticity, with an initial depression followed by a potentiation after a recovery period. Optogenetic and electrical stimulation also induced significant increases in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs, even after single-cell stimulation. In addition, we observed unexpected strong and persistent increases in neuronal excitability after stimulation, with increases in membrane resistance and reductions in spike threshold. A pharmacological agent that blocks changes in membrane resistance can revert this effect. These significant increases in excitability may partly generate the observed biphasic synaptic plasticity. We propose that cell-intrinsic changes in excitability are involved in the formation of neuronal ensembles. We propose an 'iceberg' model, by which increased neuronal excitability makes subthreshold connections suprathreshold, enhancing the effect of already existing synapses, and generating a new neuronal ensemble.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Male rat leukocyte population dynamics predict a window for intervention in aging</a></h4>

              
                Many age-associated changes in the human hematopoietic system have been reproduced in murine models; however, such changes have not been as robustly explored in rats despite the fact these larger rodents are more physiologically similar to humans. We examined peripheral blood of male F344 rats ranging from three to twenty-seven months of age and found significant age-associated changes with distinct leukocyte population shifts. We report CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> population frequency is a strong predictor of healthy aging, generate a model using blood parameters, and find rats with blood profiles that diverge from chronologic age indicate debility; thus, assessments of blood composition may be useful for non-lethal disease profiling or as a surrogate measure for efficacy of aging interventions. Importantly, blood parameters and DNA methylation alterations, defined distinct juncture points during aging, supporting a non-linear aging process. Our results suggest these inflection points are important considerations for aging interventions. Overall, we present rat blood aging metrics that can serve as a resource to evaluate health and the effects of interventions in a model system physiologically more reflective of humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">De novo-designed transmembrane domains tune engineered receptor functions</a></h4>

              
                De novo-designed receptor transmembrane domains (TMDs) present opportunities for precise control of cellular receptor functions. We developed a de novo design strategy for generating programmed membrane proteins (proMPs): single-pass α-helical TMDs that self-assemble through computationally defined and crystallographically validated interfaces. We used these proMPs to program specific oligomeric interactions into a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that we expressed in mouse primary T cells and found that both in vitro CAR T cell cytokine release and in vivo antitumor activity scaled linearly with the oligomeric state encoded by the receptor TMD, from monomers up to tetramers. All programmed CARs stimulated substantially lower T cell cytokine release relative to the commonly used CD28 TMD, which we show elevated cytokine release through lateral recruitment of the endogenous T cell costimulatory receptor CD28. Precise design using orthogonal and modular TMDs thus provides a new way to program receptor structure and predictably tune activity for basic or applied synthetic biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Role of oxidation of excitation-contraction coupling machinery in age-dependent loss of muscle function in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Age-dependent loss of body wall muscle function and impaired locomotion occur within 2 weeks in <i>C. elegans</i>; however, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In humans, age-dependent loss of muscle function occurs at about 80 years of age and has been linked to dysfunction of ryanodine receptor (RyR)/intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) release channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Mammalian skeletal muscle RyR1 channels undergo age-related remodeling due to oxidative overload, leading to loss of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the channel macromolecular complex. This destabilizes the closed state of the channel resulting in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak, reduced muscle function, and impaired exercise capacity. We now show that the <i>C. elegans</i> RyR homolog, <i>UNC-68</i>, exhibits a remarkable degree of evolutionary conservation with mammalian RyR channels and similar age-dependent dysfunction. Like RyR1 in mammals <i>UNC-</i>68 encodes a protein that comprises a macromolecular complex which includes the calstabin1 homolog FKB-2 and is immunoreactive with antibodies raised against the RyR1 complex. Further, as in aged mammals, <i>UNC-68</i> is oxidized and depleted of FKB-2 in an age-dependent manner, resulting in 'leaky' channels, depleted SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, reduced body wall muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and age-dependent muscle weakness. FKB-2 <i>(ok3007)-</i>deficient worms exhibit reduced exercise capacity. Pharmacologically induced oxidization of <i>UNC-68</i> and depletion of FKB-2 from the channel independently caused reduced body wall muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Preventing FKB-2 depletion from the <i>UNC-68</i> macromolecular complex using the Rycal drug S107 improved muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and function. Taken together, these data suggest that <i>UNC-68</i> oxidation plays a role in age-dependent loss of muscle function. Remarkably, this age-dependent loss of muscle function induced by oxidative overload, which takes ~2 years in mice and ~80 years in humans, occurs in less than 2-3 weeks in <i>C. elegans</i>, suggesting that reduced antioxidant capacity may contribute to the differences in life span amongst species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Short senolytic or senostatic interventions rescue progression of radiation-induced frailty and premature ageing in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cancer survivors suffer from progressive frailty, multimorbidity and premature morbidity. We hypothesize that therapy-induced senescence and senescence progression via bystander effects is a significant cause of this premature ageing phenotype. Accordingly, the study addresses the question whether a short anti-senescence intervention is able to block progression of radiation-induced frailty and disability in a pre-clinical setting. Male mice were sub-lethally irradiated at 5 months of age and treated (or not) with either a senolytic drug (Navitoclax or dasatinib + quercetin) for 10 days or with the senostatic metformin for 10 weeks. Follow up was for one year. Treatments commencing within a month after irradiation effectively reduced frailty progression (p&lt;0.05) and improved muscle (p&lt;0.01) and liver (p&lt;0.05) function as well as short-term memory (p&lt;0.05) until advanced age with no need for repeated interventions. Senolytic interventions that started late, after radiation-induced premature frailty was manifest, still had beneficial effects on frailty (p&lt;0.05) and short-term memory (p&lt;0.05). Metformin was similarly effective as senolytics. At therapeutically achievable concentrations metformin acted as a senostatic neither via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, nor via improvement of mitophagy or mitochondrial function, but by reducing non-mitochondrial ROS production via NOX4 inhibition in senescent cells. Our study suggests that the progression of adverse long-term health and quality-of-life effects of radiation exposure, as experienced by cancer survivors, might be rescued by short-term adjuvant anti-senescence interventions.

                Brain organoids have been used to recapitulate the processes of brain development and related diseases. However, the lack of vasculatures, which regulate neurogenesis and brain disorders, limits the utility of brain organoids. In this study, we induced vessel and brain organoids respectively, and then fused two types of organoids together to obtain vascularized brain organoids. The fused brain organoids were engrafted with robust vascular network-like structures, and exhibited increased number of neural progenitors, in line with the possibility that vessels regulate neural development. Fusion organoids also contained functional blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-like structures, as well as microglial cells, a specific population of immune cells in the brain. The incorporated microglia responded actively to immune stimuli to the fused brain organoids and showed ability of engulfing synapses. Thus, the fusion organoids established in this study allow modeling interactions between the neuronal and non-neuronal components <i>in vitro</i>, in particular the vasculature and microglia niche.

                Homeostatic synaptic plasticity adjusts the strength of synapses to restrain neuronal activity within a physiological range. Postsynaptic GKAP controls the bidirectional synaptic scaling of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) however how chronic activity triggers postsynaptic protein remodeling to downscale synaptic transmission is barely understood. Here we report that the microtubule-dependent kinesin motor KIF21B interacts with GKAP and likewise enters dendritic spines in a myosin Va- and activity-dependent manner. We observed that under conditions of chronic activity KIF21B regulates actin dynamics in spines, triggers spine removal of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, and mediates homeostatic synaptic downscaling of AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSC amplitudes. Our data highlight a myosin-kinesin interaction that enables the entry of the microtubule-dependent motor KIF21B into actin-rich spine compartments. A slow actin turnover rate might be beneficial for efficient protein removal from excitatory synapses, suggesting a functional role of KIF21B in a GKAP- and AMPA receptor-dependent mechanism, underlying homeostatic downscaling of neuronal firing.

                Purpose: In positron emission tomography (PET) quantification, multiple pharmacokinetic parameters are typically estimated from each time activity curve. Conventionally, all but the parameter of interest are discarded before performing subsequent statistical analysis. However, we assert that these discarded parameters also contain relevant information which can be exploited to improve the precision and power of statistical analyses on the parameter of interest. Properly taking this into account can thereby draw more informative conclusions without collecting more data. Methods: By applying a hierarchical multifactor multivariate Bayesian approach, all estimated parameters from all regions can be analysed at once. We refer to this method as PuMBA (Parameters undergoing Multivariate Bayesian Analysis). We simulated patient-control studies with different radioligands, varying sample sizes and measurement error to explore its performance, comparing the precision, statistical power, false positive rate and bias of estimated group differences relative to univariate analysis methods. Results: We show that PuMBA improves the statistical power for all examined applications relative to univariate methods without increasing the false positive rate. PuMBA improves the precision of effect size estimation, and reduces the variation of these estimates between simulated samples. Furthermore, we show that PuMBA yields performance improvements even in the presence of substantial measurement error. Remarkably, owing to its ability to leverage information shared between pharmacokinetic parameters, PuMBA even shows greater power than conventional univariate analysis of the true binding values from which the parameters were simulated. Across all applications, PuMBA exhibited a small degree of bias in the estimated outcomes, however this was small relative to the variation in estimated outcomes between simulated datasets. Conclusion: PuMBA improves the precision and power of statistical analysis of PET data without requiring the collection of additional measurements. This makes it possible to study new research questions in both new and previously collected data. PuMBA therefore holds great promise for the field of PET imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Retinoic acid-gated BDNF synthesis in neuronal dendrites drives presynaptic homeostatic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a non-Hebbian synaptic mechanism that adjusts synaptic strength to maintain network stability while achieving optimal information processing. Among the molecular mediators shown to regulate this form of plasticity, synaptic signaling through retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor, RAR, has been shown to be critically involved in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic transmission in both hippocampus and sensory cortices. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism through which postsynaptic RA and RAR regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release during prolonged synaptic inactivity at excitatory synapses. We show that RAR binds to a subset of dendritically sorted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA splice isoforms and represses their translation. The RA-mediated translational de-repression of postsynaptic BDNF results in the retrograde activation of presynaptic Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors, facilitating presynaptic homeostatic compensation through enhanced presynaptic release. Together, our study illustrates a RA-mediated retrograde synaptic signaling pathway through which postsynaptic protein synthesis during synaptic inactivity drives compensatory changes at presynaptic site.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A pro-oxidant combination of resveratrol and copper down-regulates multiple biological hallmarks of ageing and neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Several hundred billion to a trillion cells die in the body every day, and cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) that are released from them enter into the extracellular compartments of the body, including into the circulation. We have earlier reported that cfChPs can readily enter into healthy cells to damage their DNA, activate apoptotic pathways and induce inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that repeated lifelong assault on healthy cells by cfChPs is the underlying cause of ageing, and that the ageing process could be retarded by deactivating cfChPs. The latter can be effected by oxygen radicals that are generated upon admixing the nutraceuticals resveratrol (R) and copper (Cu). Using confocal microscopy and antibodies against DNA and histone we detected copious presence of extra-cellular cfChPs in brain of ageing mice, and observed that these were eradicated following prolong oral administration of small quantities of R-Cu. Eradication of cfChPs was associated with down-regulation of several biological hallmarks of ageing in brain cells which included reduction in: 1) telomere attrition, 2) amyloid deposition, 3) DNA damage, 4) apoptosis, 5) inflammation, 6) senescence, 7) aneuploidy and 8) mitochondrial dysfunction. At a systemic level, R-Cu treatment led to significant reduction in blood levels of glucose, cholesterol and C-reactive protein. These results suggest that cfChPs may be global instigators of ageing and neurodegeneration, and that therapeutic use of R-Cu may help to retard the process of ageing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plasma miRNA-214 is a predictive candidate biomarker of progression speed in patients with ALS</a></h4>

              
                This study was designed to develop and validate a reliable biomarker to predict the progression speed reflecting immune function of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). After establishing the induced microglia model (iMGs) derived from peripheral blood monocytes, comparative studies to find factors related to phagocytic differences between iMGs of patients with rapidly progressive ALS [ALS(R)-iMGs, n = 15] and those of patients with slowly progressive ALS [ALS(S)-iMGs, n = 14] were conducted in the discovery cohort. To validate discovered candidate and whether it could be used as a reliable biomarker predicting the progression speed of ALS, we recruited 132 patients with ALS and 30 age-matched healthy controls as the validation cohort. ALS(R)-iMGs showed impaired phagocytic function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the perturbed phagocytosis in ALS(R)-iMGs was related to the decreased expression of NCKAP1 (NCK-associated protein 1) and NCKAP1 overexpression rescued the impaired phagocytic function. miRNA-214-3p targeting NCKAP1 in ALS-iMGs was correlated with progression speed in the discovery cohort. The validation cohort revealed that plasma miRNA-214-3p levels were significantly increased in ALS patients (p < 0.0001, AUC = 0.839), correlated with disease progression speed (p = 0.0005), and distinguished the rapidly progressive subgroup (Q1) from the slowly progressive (Q4, p = 0.029), respectively. Plasma miRNA-214-3p can predict the progression speed in ALS. Plasma miRNA-214-3p could be used as a simple and easily accessible biomarker for predicting the future progression speed related to phagocytic dysfunction in ALS patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expression of GDNF Receptors Within Nucleus Ambiguus During Rat Development</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Upregulation of GDNF and its receptors is observed during laryngeal reinnervation after nerve injury. In contrast, little is known regarding the expression of GDNF receptors in the formation of the nucleus ambiguus (NA) and its innervation of the larynx during embryogenesis. Differences may suggest therapeutic targets after nerve injury. Study Design: Laboratory experiment. Methods: Rat brainstems at E14, E16, E18, E20, adult (4 animals/timepoint) were sectioned and stained for GDNF receptors: GFR-1, GFR-2, GFR-3, and Ret. Islet1 and ChAT were used as markers for motoneuron cell bodies. Sections were observed using Zeiss Axio Imager M2 Microscope and quantified using Image J. Results: Expression of all four GDNF receptors was identified within the nucleus ambiguus, as well as hypoglossal and facial nuclei of the adult rat brainstem. During rat development, GFR-3 and Ret exhibited upregulation within the nucleus ambiguus at E14 whereas GFR-1 began showing upregulation at E20. GFR-2 exhibited no upregulation at embryonic timepoints. Conclusion: Upregulation of the GDNF receptors within the nucleus ambiguus occur after laryngeal muscles innervation during development and may associated with maturation and maintenance of the neuromuscular synapses of the larynx before and after birth. No differences among ambiguus, hypoglossal, and facial nuclei was observed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task prioritization modulates low frequency EEG dynamics reflecting proactive cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Most neuroscientific studies investigating mental effort apply unspecific effort allocation paradigms. In contrast, the present EEG study targets specific effort allocation during task prioritization. Twenty-eight participants performed a cued number classification task during the retention interval of a working memory task including retrospective cues. One of two possible number classifications was done per trial. Each trial started with a cue indicating which of the two tasks would be more important in the upcoming trial. Subjects were told to engage in both tasks, but to concentrate on the important one. Feedback given at the end of each trial was calculated based on task performance, with scores obtained from the relevant task being tripled. Participants performed significantly better in either task when it was important compared to when not. Task prioritization modulates theta, alpha and beta oscillations, predominantly during task preparation. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that the exact type of the two possible number classifications was decodable, however, decoding accuracy did not depend on task importance. Hemispheric alpha power asymmetries indicating attentional orienting between working memory representations also did not depend on task importance. The findings suggest that task prioritization primarily affects proactive cognitive control on a superordinate level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A potent and selective inhibitor for the modulation of MAGL activity in the neurovasculature</a></h4>

              
                Chronic inflammation and blood-brain barrier dysfunction are key pathological hallmarks of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. Major drivers of these pathologies include pro-inflammatory stimuli such as prostaglandins, which are produced in the central nervous system by the oxidation of arachidonic acid in a reaction catalyzed by the cyclooxygenases COX1 and COX2. Monoacylglycerol lipase hydrolyzes the endocannabinoid signaling lipid 2-arachidonyl glycerol, enhancing local pools of arachidonic acid in the brain and leading to cyclooxygenase-mediated prostaglandin production and neuroinflammation. Monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitors were recently shown to act as effective anti-inflammatory modulators, increasing 2-arachidonyl glycerol levels while reducing levels of arachidonic acid and prostaglandins, including PGE2 and PGD2. In this study, we characterized a novel, highly selective, potent and reversible monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor (MAGLi 432) in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced blood-brain barrier permeability and in both human and mouse cells of the neurovascular unit: brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes. We confirmed the expression of monoacylglycerol lipase in specific neurovascular unit cells in vitro, with pericytes showing the highest expression level and activity. However, MAGLi 432 did not ameliorate lipopolysaccharide-induced blood-brain barrier permeability in vivo or reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. Our data confirm monoacylglycerol lipase expression in mouse and human cells of the neurovascular unit and provide the basis for further cell-specific analysis of MAGLi 432 in the context of blood-brain barrier dysfunction caused by inflammatory insults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hybrid offspring of C57BL/6J mice exhibit improved properties for neurobehavioral research</a></h4>

              
                C57BL/6 is the most commonly used mouse strain in neurobehavioral research, serving as a background for multiple transgenic lines. However, C57BL/6 exhibit behavioral and sensorimotor disadvantages that worsen with age. We bred FVB/NJ females and C57BL/6J males to generate first-generation hybrid offspring, (FVB/NJ x C57BL/6J)F1. The hybrid mice exhibit reduced anxiety-like behavior, improved learning, and enhanced long-term spatial memory. In contrast to both progenitors, older hybrids maintain sensorimotor performance and exhibit improved long-term memory. The hybrids are larger than C57BL/6J, exhibiting enhanced running behavior on a linear track during freely-moving electrophysiological recordings. Hybrids exhibit typical rate and phase coding of space by CA1 pyramidal cells. Hybrids generated by crossing FVB/NJ females with transgenic males of a C57BL/6 background support optogenetic neuronal control in neocortex and hippocampus. The hybrid mice pro-vide an improved model for neurobehavioral studies combining complex behavior, electrophysiology, and genetic tools readily available in C57BL/6 mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced cognitive interference during visuomotor tasks may cause eye-hand dyscoordination</a></h4>

              
                In complex visuomotor tasks, such as cooking, people make many saccades to continuously search for items before and during reaching movements. These tasks require use of short-term memory and task-switching (e.g., switching search between vegetables and spices). Cognitive load may affect visuomotor performance by increasing the demands on mental processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex, but mechanisms remain unclear. It is also unclear how patients with neurological injuries, e.g., stroke survivors, manage greater cognitive loads during visuomotor tasks. Using the Trail-Making Test, we have previously shown that stroke survivors make many more saccades, which are associated limb movements that are less smooth and slower. In this test, participants search for and make reaching movements towards twenty-five numbers and letters. It has a simple variant (Trails-A), and a cognitively challenging variant (Trails-B) that requires alphanumeric switching. The switching makes the task gradually harder as the Trails-B trial progresses (greater cognitive load). Here, we show that stroke survivors and healthy controls made many more saccades and had longer fixations as the Trails-B trial progressed. In addition, reaching speed slowed down for controls in Trails-B. We propose a mechanism where enhanced cognitive load may reduce inhibition from the prefrontal cortex and disinhibit the ocular motor system into making more saccades. These additional saccades may subsequently slow down motor function by disrupting the visual feedback loops used to control limb movements. These findings augment our understanding of the mechanisms that underpin cognitive interference dynamics when visual, ocular, and limb motor systems interact in visuocognitive motor tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single trial variability in neural activity during a working memory task: A window into multiple distinct information processing sequences</a></h4>

              
                Successful encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of information stored in working memory requires persistent coordination of activity among multiple brain regions. It is generally assumed that the pattern of such coordinated activity remains constant for a given task, and therefore to account for noisy data, multiple trials of the same task are performed, and the neural response is averaged across trials to generate an event-related potential (ERP). However, here we show that from trial to trial, the neuronal activity recorded with electroencephalogram (EEG) is actually spatially and temporally diverse, conflicting with the assumption of a single pattern of coordinated response for a given task. We develop a data-driven classification method based on community detection to identify trials with unique spatial and temporal activity and establish that variability in neuronal activity among single time-locked trials arises from the presence of distinct forms of stimulus dependent synchronized activity (i.e., ERPs). The patterns of neuronal activity among trials are limited to a few distinct clusters, or subtypes, that are spatially and temporally distinct and associated with differences in decision-making processes. These results demonstrate that differences in the patterns of neural activity during working memory tasks represent fluctuations in the engagement of distinct brain regions and cognitive processes, suggesting that the brain can choose from multiple mechanisms to perform a given task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal PHATE: A multi-view manifold learningmethod for brain state trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Brain activity as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) gives the illusion of intractably high dimensionality, rife with collection and biological noise. Nonlinear dimensionality reductions like UMAP, tSNE, and PHATE have proven useful for high-throughput biomedical data, but have not been extensively used in fMRI, which is known to reflect the redundancy and co-modulation of neural population activity. Here we take the manifold-geometry preserving method PHATE and extend it for use in brain activity timeseries data in a method we call temporal PHATE (T-PHATE). We observe that in addition to the intrinsically lower dimensionality of fMRI data, it also has significant autocorrelative structure that we can exploit to faithfully denoise the signal and learn brain activation manifolds. We empirically validate T-PHATE on three fMRI tasks and show that T-PHATE manifolds improve visualization fidelity, stimulus feature classification, and neural event segmentation. T-PHATE demonstrates impressive improvements over previous cutting-edge approaches to understanding the nature of cognition from fMRI and bodes potential applications broadly for high-dimensional datasets of temporally-diffuse processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">HIV integration in the human brain is linked to microglial activation and 3D genome remodeling</a></h4>

              
                Exploration of genome organization and function in the HIV infected brain is critical to aid in the development of treatments for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and HIV cure strategies. Here, we generated a resource comprised of single nuclei transcriptomics, complemented by cell-type-specific Hi-C chromosomal conformation (3D genome) and viral integration site sequencing (IS-seq) in frontal brain tissues from individuals with HIV encephalitis (HIVE), HIV-infected people without encephalitis (HIV+), and HIV uninfected (HIV-) controls. We observed profound 3D genomic reorganization of open/repressive (A/B) compartment structures encompassing 6.4% of the HIVE microglial genome that was associated with transcriptomic reprogramming, including down-regulation of homeostasis and synapse-related functions and robust activation of interferon signaling and cell migratory pathways. HIV RNA was detected in 0.003% of all nuclei in HIVE brain, predominantly in the most activated microglia where it ranked as the second most highly expressed transcript. Microglia from HIV+ brains showed, to a lesser extent, similar transcriptional alterations. IS-seq recovered 1,221 insertion events in glial nuclei that were enriched for chromosomal domains newly mobilized into a permissive chromatin environment in HIVE microglia. Brain and peripheral myeloid cell integration revealed a preference overall for transcription-permissive chromatin, but robust differences in the frequency of recurrent insertions, intergenic integration, and enrichment for pre-integration complex-associated factors at integration sites. Our resource highlights critical differences in the genomic patterns of HIV infection in brain versus blood and points to a dynamic interrelationship between inflammation-associated 3D genome remodeling and successful integration in brain.

                Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the gene encoding the huntingtin (Htt) protein, with mutant Htt protein subsequently forming aggregates within the brain. Mutant Htt is a current target for novel therapeutic strategies for HD, however, the lack of translation from preclinical research to disease-modifying treatments highlights the need to improve our understanding of the role of Htt protein in the human brain. This study aims to undertake a high-throughput screen of 12 candidate antibodies against various sequences along the Htt protein to characterize Htt distribution and expression in post-mortem human brain tissue microarrays (TMAs). Immunohistochemistry was performed on middle temporal gyrus TMAs comprising of up to 28 HD and 27 age-matched control cases, using 12 antibodies specific to various sequences along the Htt protein. From this study, six antibodies directed to the Htt N-terminus successfully immunolabelled human brain tissue. The Htt aggregates and Htt protein expression levels for the six successful antibodies were subsequently quantified with high-throughput analysis. Htt aggregates were detected in HD cases using antibodies MAB5374, MW1, and EPR5526, despite no change in overall Htt protein expression compared to control cases, suggesting a redistribution of Htt into aggregates in HD. Significant associations were found between the number of Htt aggregates and both age of disease onset, and CAG repeat length in HD. However, the number of Htt aggregates did not correlate with the degree of striatal degeneration or the degree of cortical neuron loss. Together, these results suggest that longer CAG repeat lengths correlate with Htt aggregation in the HD human brain, and Htt cortical aggregate deposition is associated with the onset of clinical symptoms. This study also reinforces that antibodies MAB5492, MW8, and 2B7 which have been utilized to characterize Htt in animal models of HD are not specific for Htt in human brain tissue, thereby highlighting the need for validated means of Htt detection to support drug development for HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Within- and between-subject reproducibility and variability in multi-modal, longitudinal brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Network analysis provides new and important insights into the function of complex systems such as the brain by examining structural and functional networks constructed from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI), functional MRI (fMRI) and Electro/Magnetoencephalography (E/MEG) data. Although network models can shed light on cognition and pathology, questions remain regarding the importance of these findings, due in part to the reproducibility of the core measurements and subsequent modeling strategies. In order to ensure that results are reproducible, we need a better understanding of within- and between-subject variability over long periods of time. Here, we analyze a longitudinal, 8 session, multi-modal (dMRI, and simultaneous EEG-fMRI), and multiple task imaging data set. We first investigate the reproducibility of individual brain connections and network measures and find that across all modalities, within-subject reproducibility is higher than between-subject reproducibility, reaffirming the ability to detect individual differences in network structure in both structural and functional human brain networks. We see high variability in the reproducibility of pairwise connections between brain regions, but observe that in EEG-derived networks, during both rest and task, alpha-band connectivity is consistently more reproducible than networks derived from other frequency bands. Further, reproducible connections correspond to strong connections. Structural networks show a higher reliability in network statistics than functional networks, and certain measures such as synchronizability and eigenvector centrality are consistently less reliable than other network measures across all modalities. Finally, we find that structural dMRI networks outperform functional networks in their ability to identify individuals using a fingerprinting analysis. Our results highlight that functional networks likely reflect state-dependent variability not present in structural networks, and that the analysis of either structural or functional networks to study individual differences should depend on whether or not one wants to take into account state dependencies of the observed networks.

                Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the Transcription Factor 4 gene (TCF4). One pathobiological process caused by Tcf4 mutation is a cell autonomous reduction in oligodendrocytes (OLs) and myelination. In this study, we show that clemastine is effective at restoring myelination defects in a PTHS mouse model. In vitro, clemastine treatment reduced excess oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and normalized OL density. In vivo, two-week intraperitoneal administration of clemastine also normalized OPC and OL density in the cortex of Tcf4 mutant mice and appeared to increase the number of axons undergoing myelination, as EM imaging of the corpus callosum showed a significant increase in uncompacted myelin. Importantly, this treatment paradigm resulted in functional rescue by improving electrophysiology and behavior. Together, these results provide preclinical evidence that remyelination therapies may be beneficial in PTHS and potentially other neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by demyelination.

                The use of iPSC derived brain organoid models to study neurodegenerative disease has been hampered by a lack of systems that accurately and expeditiously recapitulate pathogenesis in the context of neuron-glial interactions. Here we report development of a system, termed AstTau, which propagates toxic human tau oligomers in iPSC derived neuron-astrocyte spheroids. The AstTau system develops much of the neuronal and astrocytic pathology observed in tauopathies including misfolded, phosphorylated, oligomeric, and fibrillar tau, strong neurodegeneration, and reactive astrogliosis. Single cell transcriptomic profiling combined with immunochemistry characterizes a model system that can more closely recapitulate late-stage changes in adult neurodegeneration. The transcriptomic studies demonstrate striking changes in neuroinflammatory and heat shock protein (HSP) chaperone systems in the disease process. Treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor PU-H71 was used to address the putative dysfunctional HSP epichaperome and produced a strong reduction of pathology and neurodegeneration, highlighting the potential of AstTau as a rapid and reproducible tool for drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Right inferior frontal cortex damage impairs the initiation of inhibitory control, but not its implementation</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory control is one of the most important control functions in the human brain. Much of our understanding of its neural basis comes from seminal work showing that lesions to the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) increase stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), a latent variable that expresses the speed of inhibitory control. However, recent work has identified substantial limitations of the SSRT method. Notably, SSRT is confounded by trigger failures: stop-signal trials in which inhibitory control was never initiated. Such trials inflate SSRT, but are typically indicative of attentional, rather than inhibitory deficits. Here, we used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to identify stop-signal trigger failures in human rIFC lesion patients, non-rIFC lesion patients, and healthy comparisons. Furthermore, we measured scalp-EEG to detect {beta}-bursts, a neurophysiological index of inhibitory control. rIFC lesion patients showed a more than five-fold increase in trigger failure trials and did not exhibit the typical increase of stop-related frontal {beta}-bursts. However, on trials in which such {beta}-bursts did occur, rIFC patients showed the typical subsequent upregulation of {beta} over sensorimotor areas, indicating that their ability to implement inhibitory control, once triggered, is intact. These findings suggest that the role of rIFC in inhibitory control has to be fundamentally reinterpreted.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurotransmitter content heterogeneity within an interneuron class shapes inhibitory transmission at a central synapse</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter content is deemed the most basic defining criterion for neuronal classes, contrasting with the intercellular heterogeneity of many other molecular and functional features. Here we show, in the adult mouse brain, that neurotransmitter content variegation within a neuronal class is a component of its functional heterogeneity. Most Golgi cells (GoCs), the well-defined class of cerebellar interneurons inhibiting granule cells (GrCs), contain cytosolic glycine, accumulated by the neuronal transporter GlyT2, and GABA in various proportions. To assess the functional consequence of this neurotransmitter variation, we paired GrCs recordings with optogenetic stimulations of single GoCs, which preserve the intracellular transmitter mixture. We show that the strength and decay kinetics of GrCs IPSCs, which are entirely mediated by GABAA receptors are negatively correlated to the presynaptic expression of GlyT2 by GoCs. We isolate a slow spillover component of GrCs inhibition that is also affected by the expression of GlyT2, leading to a 56 % decrease in relative charge. Acute manipulations of cytosolic GABA and glycine supply recapitulate the modulation of IPSC charge, supporting the hypothesis that presynaptic loading of glycine negatively impact the GABAergic transmission in mixed interneurons through a competition for vesicular filling. Our results suggest that heterogeneity of neurotransmitter supply within the GoC class may provide a presynaptic mechanism to tune the gain of the stereotypic granular layer microcircuit, thereby expanding the realm of possible dynamic behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multifaceted role of RIMBP2 in promoting hearing in murine cochlear hair cells</a></h4>

              
                In peripheral, the mammalian cochlea is a remarkable sensory apparatus, owning to its outer and inner hair cells (OHCs and IHCs) that amplify and transmit auditory signals to the brain, respectively. Rab3-interacting molecular (RIM) binding protein 2 (RIMBP2) is widely expressed in receptor cells and neurons, specifically in the active zones for exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs), but its exact functions in the cochlea are not very well understood. We therefore generated a Rimbp2 knockout mouse model (Rimbp2-/-), which exhibited severely impaired hearing with not only elevated hearing thresholds but also increased latencies and reduced amplitudes in the Wave I of their auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). Consistent with the threshold elevation, we found significant loss of OHCs, likely through apoptosis, in the Rimbp2-/- cochlea. Consistent with changes observed in the ABR Wave I, we found greatly reduced exocytosis, both spontaneously and upon stimulation, in Rimbp2-/- IHCs. Specifically, our patch-clamp analysis on IHCs and postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) revealed not only reduced readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs but also reduced sustained release rate, along with complete blockade of fast endocytosis, in Rimbp2-/- IHCs. Lastly, with immunostaining of whole-mounted cochleae, we found that while the number of ribbon synapses in Rimbp2-/- IHCs was unchanged, their localization moved subtly but significantly towards the basal pole of IHCs. Taken together, we uncovered an unexpected role of RIMBP2 for OHC survival and a more extensive role in promoting IHC exocytosis than previously believed.

                Lifelong social impairments are common in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), and preclinical studies have identified gestational day (G)12 as a vulnerable timepoint for producing social deficits following binge-level PAE. While moderate (m)PAE also produces social impairments, the long-term neuroadaptations underlying them are poorly understood. Activity of the projection from the basolateral amygdala to the prelimbic cortex (BLA[-&gt;]PL) leads to social avoidance, and the PL alone is implicated in negative social behaviors, making each of these potential candidates for the neuroadaptations underlying mPAE-induced social impairments. To examine this, we first established that G12 mPAE produced sex-specific social impairments lasting into adulthood. We then chemogenetically inhibited the BLA[-&gt;]PL using Clozapine N-Oxide (CNO) during adult social testing. This revealed that CNO reduced social investigation in control males, but had no effect on mPAE males or females of either exposure, indicating that mPAE attenuated the role of this projection in regulating male social behavior and highlighting one potential mechanism by which mPAE affects male social behavior more severely. Using whole-cell electrophysiology, we also examined mPAE-induced changes to PL pyramidal cell physiology and determined that mPAE reduced the excitability of these cells, likely due to increased suppression by inhibitory interneurons. Overall, this work identified two mPAE-induced neuroadaptations that last into adulthood and which may underlie the sex-specific vulnerability to mPAE-induced social impairments. Future research is necessary to expand upon how these circuits modulate both normal and pathological social behavior, and to identify sex-specific mechanisms leading to differential vulnerability in males and females.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing ketamine-induced dissociation using human intracranial neurophysiology: brain dynamics, network activity, and interactions with propofol</a></h4>

              
                Subanesthetic doses of ketamine produce rapid and sustained anti-depressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Unfortunately, the usefulness of ketamine as a treatment is limited by its potential for abuse because of psychotropic side effects such as dissociation. Understanding the brain dynamics and the neural circuits involved in ketamine's effects could lend insight into improved therapies for depression with fewer adverse effects. It is believed that ketamine acts via NMDA receptor and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 1 (HCN1) channels to produce changes in oscillatory brain dynamics. Here we show, in humans, a detailed description of the principal oscillatory changes in cortical and subcortical structures by administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Using recordings from intracranial electrodes, we found that ketamine increased gamma oscillations within prefrontal cortical areas and the hippocampus--structures previously implicated in ketamine's antidepressant effects. Furthermore, our studies provide direct evidence of a ketamine-induced 3 Hz oscillation in posteromedial cortex that has been proposed as a mechanism for its dissociative effects. By analyzing changes in neural oscillations after the addition of propofol, whose GABAergic activity antagonizes ketamine's NMDA-mediated disinhibition alongside a shared HCN1 inhibitory effect, we identified brain dynamics that could be attributed to NMDA-mediated disinhibition versus HCN1 inhibition. Overall, our results imply that ketamine engages different neural circuits in distinct frequency-dependent patterns of activity to produce its antidepressant and dissociative sensory effects. These insights may help guide the development of novel brain dynamic biomarkers and therapeutics for depression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cardiac interoception is enhanced in blind individuals</a></h4>

              
                Blind individuals have superior abilities to perform perceptual tasks that rely on exteroceptive information, since visual deprivation is associated with massive cross-modal plasticity. However, it is unknown whether neuroplasticity after visual loss also affects interoception, i.e., the sensations arising from one's inner organs that convey information about the physiological state of the body. Herein, we examine the influence of blindness on cardiac interoception, which is an interoceptive submodality that has important links to emotional processing and bodily self-awareness. We tested 36 blind and 36 age- and sex-matched sighted volunteers and examined their cardiac interoceptive ability using a well-established heartbeat counting task. The results showed that blind individuals had significantly higher accuracy in perceiving their heartbeat than did individuals in a matched sighted control group. In contrast, there were no significant differences between the groups in the metacognitive dimensions of cardiac interception or the purely physiological measurement of heart rate, thereby underscoring that the improved accuracy likely reflects a superior perceptual sensitivity to cardiac interoceptive signals in blind individuals. We conclude that visual deprivation leads to enhanced interoception, which has important implications for the study of the extent of massive cross-modal plasticity after visual loss, understanding emotional processing in blind individuals, and learning how bodily self-awareness can develop and be sustained in the absence of visual experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning of new associations invokes a major change in modulations of cortical beta oscillations in human adults</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale cortical beta ({beta}) oscillations have been implicated in the learning processes but their role is debated. We explored the dynamics of {beta}-oscillations while 25 adult participants learned, through trial and error, novel associations between four auditory pseudowords and movements of four body extremities. We used MEG to evaluate learning-induced changes in beta modulation accompanying cue-triggered movements. Our findings showed that spatial-temporal characteristics of movement-related {beta}-oscillations underwent a major transition as learning proceeded. Early in learning, suppression of {beta}-power in multiple cortical areas occurred long before movement initiation and sustained throughout the whole behavioral trial. As learning advanced and task performance reached asymptote, the post-movement {beta}-suppression was replaced by a widespread and protracted rise in {beta}-power. The {beta}-power rise started shortly after the initiation of correct motor response and mainly comprised the prefrontal and medial temporal regions of the left hemisphere. This post-decision {beta}-power predicted trial-by-trial response times (RT) at both stages of learning (before and after the rules become familiar) but in opposite ways. When a subject started to acquire associative rules and gradually improved task performance, a decrease in RT was correlated with the increase in the post-decision {beta}-band power. Repeatedly correct implementation of the learned rules reversed this correlation in the opposite direction with faster (more confident) responses associated with the weaker post-decision {beta}-band synchronization. Our findings suggest that maximal beta activity is pertinent to a distinct stage of learning and may serve to strengthen the newly learned association in a distributed memory network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dendrify: a new framework for seamless incorporation of dendrites in Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Computational modeling has been indispensable for understanding how subcellular neuronal features influence circuit processing. However, the role of dendritic computations in network-level operations remains largely unexplored. This is partly because existing tools do not allow the development of realistic and efficient network models that account for dendrites. Current spiking neural networks, although efficient, are usually quite simplistic, overlooking essential dendritic properties. Conversely, circuit models with morphologically detailed neuron models are computationally costly, thus impractical for large-network simulations. To bridge the gap between these two extremes, we introduce Dendrify, an open-source Python package compatible with Brian2, designed to facilitate the development of bioinspired spiking neural networks. Dendrify, through simple commands, automatically generates reduced compartmental neuron models with simplified yet biologically relevant dendritic and synaptic integrative properties. Such models strike a good balance between flexibility, performance, and biological accuracy, allowing us to explore dendritic contributions to network-level functions while paving the way for developing more powerful neuromorphic systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Space-time resolved inference-based whole-brain neurophysiological mechanism imaging: application to resting-state alpha rhythm</a></h4>

              
                Neural mechanisms are complex and difficult to image. This paper presents a new space-time resolved whole-brain imaging framework, called Neurophysiological Mechanism Imaging (NMI), that identifies neurophysiological mechanisms within cerebral cortex at the macroscopic scale. By fitting neural mass models to electromagnetic source imaging data using a novel nonlinear inference method, population averaged membrane potentials and synaptic connection strengths are efficiently and accurately imaged across the whole brain at a resolution afforded by source imaging. The efficiency of the framework enables return of the augmented source imaging results overnight using high performance computing. This suggests it can be used as a practical and novel imaging tool. To demonstrate the framework, it has been applied to resting-state magnetoencephalographic source estimates. The results suggest that endogenous inputs to cingulate, occipital, and inferior frontal cortex are essential modulators of resting-state alpha power. Moreover, endogenous input and inhibitory and excitatory neural populations play varied roles in mediating alpha power in different resting-state sub-networks. The framework can be applied to arbitrary neural mass models and has broad applicability to image neural mechanisms in different brain states.
