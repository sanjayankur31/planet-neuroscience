              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence for Independent Processing of Shape by Vision and Touch</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Although visual object recognition is well studied and relatively well understood, much less is known about how shapes are recognized by touch and how such haptic stimuli might be compared with visual shapes. One might expect that the processes of visual and haptic object recognition engage similar brain structures given the advantages of avoiding redundant brain circuitry and indeed there is some evidence that this is the case. A potentially fruitful approach to understanding the differences in how shapes might be neurally represented is to find an algorithmic method of comparing shapes, which agrees with human behavior and determines whether that method differs between different modality conditions. If not, it would provide further evidence for a shared representation of shape. We recruited human participants to perform a one-back same&ndash;different visual and haptic shape comparison task both within (i.e., comparing two visual shapes or two haptic shapes) and across (i.e., comparing visual with haptic shapes) modalities. We then used various shape metrics to predict performance based on the shape, orientation, and modality of the two stimuli that were being compared on each trial. We found that the metrics that best predict shape comparison behavior heavily depended on the modality of the two shapes, suggesting differences in which features are used for comparing shapes depending on modality and that object recognition is not necessarily performed in a single, modality-agnostic region.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Size regulation of multiple organelles competing for a limiting subunit pool</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Deb Sankar Banerjee, Shiladitya Banerjee</p>

How cells regulate the size of intracellular structures and organelles is a longstanding question. Recent experiments suggest that size control of intracellular structures is achieved through the depletion of a limiting subunit pool in the cytoplasm. While the limiting pool model ensures organelle-to-cell size scaling, it does not provide a mechanism for robust size control of multiple co-existing structures. Here we develop a generalized theory for size-dependent growth of intracellular structures to demonstrate that robust size control of multiple intracellular structures, competing for a limiting subunit pool, is achieved via a negative feedback between the growth rate and the size of the individual structure. This design principle captures size maintenance of a wide variety of subcellular structures, from cytoskeletal filaments to three-dimensional organelles. We identify the feedback motifs for structure size regulation based on known molecular processes, and compare our theory to existing models of size regulation in biological assemblies. Furthermore, we show that positive feedback between structure size and growth rate can lead to bistable size distribution and spontaneous size selection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic perturbation of an artificial neural network: A step towards quantifying causal contributions in the brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kayson Fakhar, Claus C. Hilgetag</p>

Lesion inference analysis is a fundamental approach for characterizing the causal contributions of neural elements to brain function. This approach has gained new prominence through the arrival of modern perturbation techniques with unprecedented levels of spatiotemporal precision. While inferences drawn from brain perturbations are conceptually powerful, they face methodological difficulties. Particularly, they are challenged to disentangle the true causal contributions of the involved elements, since often functions arise from coalitions of distributed, interacting elements, and localized perturbations have unknown global consequences. To elucidate these limitations, we systematically and exhaustively lesioned a small artificial neural network (ANN) playing a classic arcade game. We determined the functional contributions of all nodes and links, contrasting results from sequential single-element perturbations with simultaneous perturbations of multiple elements. We found that lesioning individual elements, one at a time, produced biased results. By contrast, multi-site lesion analysis captured crucial details that were missed by single-site lesions. We conclude that even small and seemingly simple ANNs show surprising complexity that needs to be addressed by multi-lesioning for a coherent causal characterization.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Metastable spiking networks in the replica-mean-field limit</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luyan Yu, Thibaud O. Taillefumier</p>

Characterizing metastable neural dynamics in finite-size spiking networks remains a daunting challenge. We propose to address this challenge in the recently introduced replica-mean-field (RMF) limit. In this limit, networks are made of infinitely many replicas of the finite network of interest, but with randomized interactions across replicas. Such randomization renders certain excitatory networks fully tractable at the cost of neglecting activity correlations, but with explicit dependence on the finite size of the neural constituents. However, metastable dynamics typically unfold in networks with mixed inhibition and excitation. Here, we extend the RMF computational framework to point-process-based neural network models with exponential stochastic intensities, allowing for mixed excitation and inhibition. Within this setting, we show that metastable finite-size networks admit multistable RMF limits, which are fully characterized by stationary firing rates. Technically, these stationary rates are determined as the solutions of a set of delayed differential equations under certain regularity conditions that any physical solutions shall satisfy. We solve this original problem by combining the resolvent formalism and singular-perturbation theory. Importantly, we find that these rates specify probabilistic pseudo-equilibria which accurately capture the neural variability observed in the original finite-size network. We also discuss the emergence of metastability as a stochastic bifurcation, which can be interpreted as a static phase transition in the RMF limits. In turn, we expect to leverage the static picture of RMF limits to infer purely dynamical features of metastable finite-size networks, such as the transition rates between pseudo-equilibria.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrated view and comparative analysis of baseline protein expression in mouse and rat tissues</a></h4>

The increasingly large amount of proteomics data in the public domain enables, among other applications, the combined analyses of datasets to create comparative protein expression maps covering different organisms and different biological conditions. Here we have reanalysed public proteomics datasets from mouse and rat tissues (14 and 9 datasets, respectively), to assess baseline protein abundance. Overall, the aggregated dataset contained 23 individual datasets, including a total of 211 samples coming from 34 different tissues across 14 organs, comprising 9 mouse and 3 rat strains, respectively.
In all cases, we studied the distribution of canonical proteins between the different organs. The number of canonical proteins per dataset ranged from 273 (tendon) and 9,715 (liver) in mouse, and from 101 (tendon) and 6,130 (kidney) in rat. Then, we studied how protein abundances compared across different datasets and organs for both species. As a key point we carried out a comparative analysis of protein expression between mouse, rat and human tissues. We observed a high level of correlation of protein expression among orthologs between all three species in brain, kidney, heart and liver samples, whereas the correlation of protein expression was generally slightly lower between organs within the same species. Protein expression results have been integrated into the resource Expression Atlas for widespread dissemination.

However, recent studies in conditions of multisensory conflict, such as when a subject experiences the rubber hand illusion or embodies an avatar in virtual reality, reveal the presence of unconscious movements that are not goal-directed, but rather aim at resolving multisensory conflicts; for example, by aligning the position of a person’s arm with that of an embodied avatar. This second, conflict-resolution imperative of movement control did not emerge in classical studies of motor adaptation and online corrections, which did not allow movements to reduce the conflicts; and has been largely ignored so far in formal theories. Here, we propose a model of movement control grounded in the theory of active inference that integrates <i>intentional</i> and <i>conflict-resolution</i> imperatives. We present three simulations showing that the active inference model is able to characterize movements guided by the intention to achieve an external goal, by the necessity to resolve multisensory conflict, or both. Furthermore, our simulations reveal a fundamental difference between the (active) inference underlying <i>intentional</i> and <i>conflict-resolution</i> imperatives by showing that it is driven by two different (model and sensory) kinds of prediction errors. Finally, our simulations show that when movement is only guided by conflict resolution, the model incorrectly infers that is velocity is zero, as if it was not moving. This result suggests a novel speculative explanation for the fact that people are unaware of their subtle compensatory movements to avoid multisensory conflict. Furthermore, it can potentially help shed light on deficits of motor awareness that arise in psychopathological conditions.

                <p>by Siebren Faber, Ronald Roepman</p>

Being able to see the beauty of this world is a wonderful thing unfortunately unavailable to people with inherited blindness. In this issue of PLOS Biology, Mercey and colleagues present optimized expansion microscopy for retinal tissue, which represents a huge step forward in our ability to study these blinding conditions.

This Primer explores a PLOS Biology study which uses ultrastructure expansion microscopy to study the inner scaffold of the photoreceptor connecting cilium, the location of multiple proteins implicated in inherited forms of progressive sight loss such as retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis.

                Foodborne pathogens represent a significant cause of negative impacts on human health and the economy worldwide. Unfortunately, information about epidemiological insights in Latin American countries is scarce. The consumption of ready-to-eat street food in Ecuador is extensive, and information about the presence of foodborne pathogens, their virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance is negligible. This data includes the occurrence, phenotypic antibiotic resistance profiles, and antibiotic resistance genes of Enterobacterales isolated from ready-to-eat street food in Ambato, central Ecuador during 2020 and 2021. The most common genera detected were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Cronobacter spp. Agar disk diffusion assays were performed to determine their phenotypic resistance. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes conferring resistance against colistin, β-Lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, and amphenicols was detected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification.

                Background: This paper reports on the first stage of a larger research project on the education of delinquent youths in Malaysia. Specifically, this paper addresses the challenges of educating delinquent youths in the country. As a developing nation, Malaysia faces various issues pertaining social and youth development. The question explored in this study is whether delinquent youths in Malaysia are neglected in terms of systematic and adequate education. In Malaysia, delinquent youths are sent to correctional facilities all around the country, where they are separated from school systems, their families and communities; it can be argued that these youths are deprived of moral support from society. This paper aims to identify the challenges around educating delinquent youths in Malaysia and to recommend potential solutions to these challenges. Methods: The research approaches adopted for this paper included content analysis of printed documents and preliminary informal interviews with the staff at one correctional facility. Content analysis data were gathered from departmental and government documents made public as well as past research on delinquent youths. Meanwhile, a curtesy visit was made to a correctional facility in Kuala Lumpur to obtain preliminary input into the education and training provided at the facility. Results: The authors found that there are three main challenges to sufficiently educating delinquent youths in Malaysia. These include unclear policy on the education of youths at correctional facilities; the lack of frameworks facilitating the education of these youths; and the lack of awareness and understanding on the need for educating these youths, despite their behaviors. Conclusions: The paper ends with two solutions to these challenges and future directions for the education of delinquent youths in Malaysia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain structural abnormalities in six major psychiatric disorders: shared variation and network perspectives [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Common brain abnormalities are a possible explanation for comorbidities in psychiatric disorders. Challenges in understanding these conditions are likely due to the paucity of studies able to analyze the extent and regional distribution of shared morphometric abnormalities between disorders. Recently, Opeal et al. presented an elegant rationale to investigate shared and specific morphometric measures of cortical thickness and subcortical gray matter volume between healthy individuals and subjects across six major psychiatric disorders. Although their approach has the potential to systematically portray shared brain alterations, the chosen principal component analysis solution may not address the central question of the observed shared versus specific brain alterations due to misspecification of the number of components. Given how this misspecification can lead to different conclusions, we reanalyzed Opel et al. data to thoroughly determine the number of factors to be considered, explore the alternative solution, and visualize the patterns of shared brain matter correlations using network analysis. Our approach suggests that a unidimensional solution was appropriate in this situation. The unidimensional solution indicated that brain alterations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had a significant negative component loading, suggesting that brain abnormalities found in ASD covaried with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a finding not demonstrated by the original work. Network analysis indicated that SCZ had the highest strength, BD the highest closeness, and BD and MDD had the highest betweenness in the network. This work highlights how different component solutions can lead to different conclusions, with important implications for the understanding of overlapped patterns of symptoms among six major psychiatric diseases. The network approach is complementary in indicating central markers of specific psychopathology domains. Investigations using shared-variation and network perspectives are promising for the study of pathophysiological patterns of common brain alterations.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 17 June 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31184-9">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-31184-9</a></p>Although mature and systematic theories of molecular photophysics have been developed, it is still challenging to endow clusteroluminogens (CLgens) with designed photophysical properties by manipulating through-space interactions. Here, the authors design three CLgens that show multiple emissions and white-light emission in the crystalline state, and emphasize the important role of secondary through-space interactions between the acceptor and non-conjugated donor units.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cre/lox regulated conditional rescue and inactivation with zebrafish UFlip alleles generated by CRISPR-Cas9 targeted integration</a></h4>

              
                The ability to regulate gene activity spatially and temporally is essential to investigate cell type-specific gene function during development and in postembryonic processes and disease models. The Cre/<i>lox</i> system has been widely used for performing cell and tissue-specific conditional analysis of gene function in zebrafish. However, simple and efficient methods for isolation of stable, Cre/<i>lox</i> regulated zebrafish alleles are lacking. Here we applied our GeneWeld CRISPR-Cas9 targeted integration strategy to generate floxed alleles that provide robust conditional inactivation and rescue. A universal targeting vector, UFlip, with sites for cloning short homology arms flanking a floxed 2A-mRFP gene trap, was integrated into an intron in <i>rbbp4</i> and <i>rb1</i>. <i>rbbp4<sup>off</sup></i> and <i>rb1<sup>off</sup></i> integration alleles resulted in strong mRFP expression, &gt;99% reduction of endogenous gene expression, and recapitulated known indel loss of function phenotypes. Introduction of Cre led to stable inversion of the floxed cassette, loss of mRFP expression, and phenotypic rescue. <i>rbbp4<sup>on</sup></i> and <i>rb1<sup>on</sup></i> integration alleles did not cause phenotypes in combination with a loss of function mutation. Addition of Cre led to conditional inactivation by stable inversion of the cassette, gene trapping and mRFP expression, and the expected mutant phenotype. Neural progenitor Cre drivers were used for conditional inactivation and phenotypic rescue to showcase how this approach can be used in specific cell populations. Together these results validate a simplified approach for efficient isolation of Cre/<i>lox</i> responsive conditional alleles in zebrafish. Our strategy provides a new toolkit for generating genetic mosaics and represents a significant advance in zebrafish genetics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional requirements for a Samd14-capping protein complex in stress erythropoiesis</a></h4>

              
                Acute anemia induces rapid expansion of erythroid precursors and accelerated differentiation to replenish erythrocytes. Paracrine signals involving cooperation between SCF/Kit signaling and other signaling inputs are required for the increased erythroid precursor activity in anemia. Our prior work revealed that the Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) Domain 14 (<i>Samd14</i>) gene increases the regenerative capacity of the erythroid system in a mouse genetic model and promotes stress-dependent Kit signaling. However, the mechanism underlying Samd14's role in stress erythropoiesis is unknown. We identified a protein-protein interaction between Samd14 and the α- and β heterodimers of the F-actin capping protein (CP) complex. Knockdown of the CP β subunit increased erythroid maturation in murine ex vivo cultures and decreased colony forming potential of stress erythroid precursors. In a genetic complementation assay for Samd14 activity, our results revealed that the Samd14-CP interaction is a determinant of erythroid precursor cell levels and function. Samd14-CP promotes SCF/Kit signaling in CD71<sup>med</sup> spleen erythroid precursors. Given the roles of Kit signaling in hematopoiesis and Samd14 in Kit pathway activation, this mechanism may have pathological implications in acute/chronic anemia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Loss of Elp1 disrupts trigeminal ganglion neurodevelopment in a model of Familial Dysautonomia</a></h4>

              
                Familial Dysautonomia (FD) is a sensory and autonomic neuropathy caused by mutations in <i>Elongator complex protein 1</i> (<i>ELP1</i>). FD patients have small trigeminal nerves and impaired facial pain and temperature perception. These signals are relayed by nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, a structure comprised of both neural crest- and placode-derived cells. Mice lacking <i>Elp1</i> in neural crest derivatives ('<i>Elp1</i> CKO') are born with small trigeminal ganglia, suggesting Elp1 is important for trigeminal ganglion development, yet the function of Elp1 in this context is unknown. We demonstrate that Elp1, expressed in both neural crest- and placode-derived neurons, is not required for initial trigeminal ganglion formation. However, <i>Elp1</i> CKO trigeminal neurons exhibit abnormal axon outgrowth and deficient target innervation. Developing nociceptors expressing the receptor TrkA undergo early apoptosis in <i>Elp1</i> CKO, while TrkB- and TrkC-expressing neurons are spared, indicating Elp1 supports the target innervation and survival of trigeminal nociceptors. Further, we demonstrate that specific TrkA deficits in the Elp1 CKO trigeminal ganglion reflect the neural crest lineage of most TrkA neurons, versus the placodal lineage of most TrkB and TrkC neurons. Altogether, these findings explain defects in cranial gangliogenesis that may lead to loss of facial pain and temperature sensation in FD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Obligate sexual reproduction of a homothallic fungus closely related to the Cryptococcus pathogenic species complex</a></h4>

              
                Sexual reproduction is a ubiquitous and ancient trait of eukaryotic life. While sexual organisms are usually faced with the challenge of finding a compatible mating partner, species as diverse as animals, plants, and fungi have repeatedly evolved the ability to reproduce sexually without an obligate requirement for another individual. Here, we uncovered the underlying mechanism of self-compatibility (homothallism) in <i>Cryptococcus depauperatus</i>, a fungal species sister to the clinically relevant human fungal pathogens <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and <i>Cryptococcus gattii</i> species complexes. In contrast to <i>C. neoformans</i> or <i>C. gattii</i>, which grow as a yeast in the asexual stage, and produce hyphae, basidia, and infectious spores during the sexual stage, <i>C. depauperatus</i> grows exclusively as hyphae decorated with basidia and abundant spores and appears to be continuously engaged in sexual reproduction. By combining the insights from comparative genomics and genetic analyses of mutants defective in key mating and meiosis genes, we demonstrate the sexual cycle of <i>C. depauperatus</i> involves meiosis, and reveal that self-compatibility is orchestrated by the expression, in the same cell, of an unlinked mating receptor (Ste3a) and pheromone ligand (MFa) pair seemingly derived from opposite mating types of a heterothallic (self-sterile) ancestor. We identified a putative mating-type (<i>MAT</i>) determining region containing genes phylogenetically aligned with <i>MAT</i>&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; alleles of other species, and a few <i>MAT</i>a gene alleles scattered and unlinked throughout the genome, but no homologs of the mating-type homeodomain genes <i>SXI1</i> (<i>HD1</i>) and <i>SXI2</i> (<i>HD2</i>). Comparative genomic analyses suggested a dramatic remodeling of the <i>MAT</i> locus possibly owing to reduced selective constraints to maintain mating-type genes in tight linkage, associated with a transition to self-fertility. Our findings support <i>C. depauperatus</i> as an obligately sexual, homothallic fungal species and provide additional insight into the repeated transitions between modes of sexual reproduction that have occurred throughout the fungal kingdom.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Convergent mosaic brain evolution is associated with the evolution of novel electrosensory systems in teleost fishes</a></h4>

              
                Brain region size generally scales allometrically with brain size, but mosaic shifts in brain region size independent of brain size have been found in several lineages and may be related to the evolution of behavioral novelty. African weakly electric fishes (Mormyroidea) evolved a mosaically enlarged cerebellum and hindbrain, yet the relationship to their behaviorally novel electrosensory system remains unclear. We addressed this by studying South American weakly electric fishes (Gymnotiformes) and weakly electric catfishes (<i>Synodontis</i> spp.), which evolved varying aspects of electrosensory systems, independent of mormyroids. If the mormyroid mosaic increases are related to evolving an electrosensory system, we should find similar mosaic shifts in gymnotiforms and <i>Synodontis</i>. Using micro-computed tomography scans, we quantified brain region scaling for multiple electrogenic, electroreceptive, and non-electrosensing species. We found mosaic increases in cerebellum in all three electrogenic lineages relative to non-electric lineages and mosaic increases in torus semicircularis and hindbrain associated with the evolution of electrogenesis and electroreceptor type. These results show that evolving novel electrosensory systems is repeatedly and independently associated with changes in the sizes of individual major brain regions independent of brain size, suggesting that selection can impact structural brain composition to favor specific regions involved in novel behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correlations between behavior and neuronal responses in the cochlear nucleus (CN) and inferior colliculus (IC) of behaving monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Detection of sounds is a fundamental function of the auditory system. While studies of auditory cortex have gained substantial insight into detection performance using animals performing operant conditioning tasks, previous subcortical studies have mostly taken place under anesthesia, in passively listening animals, or have not measured performance at threshold. These limitations preclude direct comparisons between neuronal responses and behavior. To address this, we simultaneously measured auditory detection performance and single-unit activity in the inferior colliculus (IC) and cochlear nucleus (CN) in macaques. The spontaneous activity and response variability of CN neurons were higher than those observed for IC neurons. Signal detection theoretic methods revealed that the magnitude of responses of IC neurons provided more reliable estimates of psychometric threshold and slope compared to the responses of CN neurons. Correlations between spike count and behavioral response emerged 50-75 ms after sound onset for most IC neurons, but for fewer neurons in the CN. Electrical stimulation of the IC enhanced or degraded detection performance, depending on the response magnitude of the neurons being stimulated. These results highlight the differences between neurometric-psychometric correlations in CN and IC, and have important implications for how subcortical information could be decoded.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A role for axon-glial interactions and Netrin-G1 signaling in the formation of low-threshold mechanoreceptor end organs</a></h4>

              
                Low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) and their cutaneous end organs convert light mechanical forces acting on the skin into electrical signals that propagate to the central nervous system. In mouse hairy skin, hair follicle-associated longitudinal lanceolate complexes, which are end organs comprising of LTMR axonal endings that intimately associate with terminal Schwann cell (TSC) processes, mediate LTMR responses to hair deflection and skin indentation. Here, we characterized developmental steps leading to the formation of A{beta} RA-LTMR and A{delta}-LTMR lanceolate complexes. During early postnatal development, A{beta} RA-LTMRs and A{delta}-LTMRs extend and prune cutaneous axonal branches in close association with nascent TSC processes. Netrin-G1 is expressed in these developing A{beta} RA-LTMR and A{delta}-LTMR lanceolate endings, and Ntng1 ablation experiments indicate that Netrin-G1 functions in sensory neurons to promote lanceolate ending elaboration around hair follicles. The Netrin-G ligand (NGL-1), encoded by Lrrc4c, is expressed in TSCs, and ablation of Lrrc4c phenocopies the lanceolate complex deficits observed in Ntng1 mutants. Moreover, NGL-1-Netrin-G1 signaling is a general mediator of LTMR end organ formation across diverse tissue types demonstrated by the fact that A{beta} RA-LTMR endings associated with Meissner corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles are also compromised in the Ntng1 and Lrrc4c mutant mice. Thus, axon-glia interactions mediated by NGL-1-Netrin-G1 signaling promote LTMR end organ formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differentiating Bayesian model updating and model revision based on their prediction error dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Within predictive processing learning is construed as Bayesian model updating with the degree of certainty for different existing hypotheses changing in light of new evidence. Bayesian model updating, however, cannot explain how new hypotheses are added to a model. Model revision, unlike model updating, makes structural changes to a generative model by altering its causal connections or adding or removing hypotheses. Whilst model updating and model revision have recently been formally differentiated, they have not been empirically distinguished. The aim of this research was to empirically differentiate between model updating and revision on the basis of how they affect prediction errors and predictions over time. To study this, participants took part in a within-subject computer-based learning experiment with two phases: updating and revision. In the updating phase, participants had to predict the relationship between cues and target stimuli and in the revision phase, they had to correctly predict a change in the said relationship. Based on previous research, phasic pupil dilation was taken as a proxy for prediction error. During model updating, we expected that the prediction errors over trials would be gradually decreasing as a reflection of the continuous integration of new evidence. During model revision, in contrast, prediction errors over trials were expected to show an abrupt decrease following the successful integration of a new hypothesis within the existing model. The opposite results were expected for predictions. Our results show that the learning dynamics as reflected in pupil and accuracy data are indeed qualitatively different between the revision and the updating phase, however in the opposite direction as expected. Participants were learning more gradually in the revision phase compared to the updating phase. This could imply that participants first built multiple models from scratch in the updating phase and updated them in the revision phase.

                With the recent findings that mutations in the gene encoding the -subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2A) causes neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), it is of great therapeutic relevance to know if there a critical developmental time window in which CAMK2A needs to be expressed for normal brain development, or whether expression of the protein at later stages is still beneficial to restore normal functioning. To answer this question, we generated an inducible Camk2a mouse model, which allows us to express CAMK2A at any desired time. Here, we show that adult expression of CAMK2A rescues the behavioural and electrophysiological phenotypes seen in the Camk2a knock-out mice, including spatial and conditional learning and synaptic plasticity. These results suggest that CAMK2A does not play a critical irreversible role in neurodevelopment, which is of importance for future therapies to treat CAMK2A-dependent disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SOX10 Expression Levels may be a Critical Mediator of White Matter Dysfunction in Schizophrenia.</a></h4>

              
                Abnormalities of brain connectivity are consistently observed in individuals with schizophrenias (SZ). Underlying these anomalies, convergent in vivo, post-mortem, and genomic evidence suggest abnormal oligodendrocyte (OL) development and function, including lower in vivo myelination in SZ. Using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs), we previously observed a significant and substantial reduction in the number of OLs produced in cells from the SZ group compared to the healthy control (HC) group. We also observed a correlation between white matter (WM) estimated in brain in vivo and the number of OLs produced in vitro. We have now characterized potential mediators that may contribute to the SZ-associated deficit in OL production. We ran qRT-PCRs to detect group-specific differences in key myelin pathway proteins. Significant reductions of PAX6 and SOX10 expression were seen in the SZ group. We focused on SOX10 since one of its functions is the commitment of precursor cells to an oligodendrocyte fate. Using an inducible lentiviral system, we expressed SOX10 in patterned neural stem cells (NSCs) and quantified the number of OLs produced. Expression of SOX10 rescued the SZ-associated deficit in OL production, indicating that reduced SOX10 may be a critical mediator of OL dysfunction in SZ. We then ran qRT-PCRs to screen mRNAs for three proteins (SOX9, QK1 and FEZ1) whose expression was directly influenced by SOX10 or directly influenced the expression of SOX10. We saw significant reductions of SOX9 expression and a reduction in QK1 expression in the SZ group. RNAseq analysis confirmed these gene expression changes.

                This paper describes the development and testing of a brain-computer musical interface (BCMI) that allows a user to select and transform one element of a musical texture by paying attention to that particular element. In order to realize the BCMI system mentioned, a comprehensive testing scheme was established which uses auditory evoked potentials to elicit P300 waves via averaging various types of stimuli. Resented sound stimuli were divided into multi-channel speaker setups to have better localization of user-focused sound stimuli. A sound synthesis model was developed for transforming its sound texture based on neural oscillations that were categorized with the help of a self-organizing map algorithm. In addition, an artificial neural network was used to predict the possible P300 waves that show the attentional focus of a subject. Most of the P300 waves were classified successfully for most of the participants. Promising results were achieved concerning the developed BCMI system. A neural network model was also utilized to predict the possible P300 waves, which show the subject's selective attention. The majority of the participants were able to correctly classify P300 waves. The proposed BCMI system yielded promising results.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A comparison of methods to suppress electrocardiographic artifacts in local field potential recordings</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Sensing-enabled neurostimulators for deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy record neural activity directly from the stimulating electrodes in the form of local field potentials (LFPs). However, these LFPs are often contaminated with electrocardiographic (ECG) artifacts that impede the detection of physiomarkers for adaptive DBS research. This study systematically compared the ability of different ECG suppression methods to recover disease-specific electrical brain activity from ECG-contaminated LFPs. Approach: Three ECG suppression methods were evaluated: (1) QRS interpolation of the Perceive toolbox, (2) four variants of a template subtraction method, and (3) sixteen variants of a singular value decomposition (SVD) method. The performance of these methods was examined using LFPs recorded with the Medtronic PerceptTM PC system from the subthalamic nucleus in nine patients with Parkinson's disease while stimulation was turned off ("OFF-DBS"; anode disconnected) and while stimulation was turned on at 0 mA ("ON-DBS 0 mA"; anode connected). In addition, ECG-contaminated LFPs were simulated by scaling a co-recorded external ECG signal and adding it to the OFF-DBS LFPs. Main Results: ECG artifacts were present in 10 out of 18 ON-DBS 0 mA recordings. All ECG suppression methods were able to drastically reduce the percent difference of beta band (13 - 35 Hz) spectral power and at least partly recover the beta peak and beta burst dynamics. Using predetermined R-peaks improved the performance of the ECG suppression methods. Lengthening the time window around the R-peaks resulted in stronger reduction in artifact-induced beta band power but at an increased risk of flattening the beta peak and loss of beta burst dynamics. Significance: The SVD method formed the preferred trade-off between artifact cleaning and signal loss, as long as its parameter settings (time window around the R-peaks; number of components) are adequately chosen.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular and functional mechanisms of long-term visual habituation in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Long-term habituation allows animals to learn to ignore persistent but unimportant stimuli. Despite being the most basic form of learning, a consensus model on the underlying mechanisms has yet to emerge. We have exploited a visual habituation paradigm in larval zebrafish, where larvae will learn to reduce their reactions to abrupt global dimming (a dark flash). Using a drug-screening approach, we first identified pathways that potently altered habituation learning, including GABAergic inhibition, Melatonin and Estrogen signaling. To determine how habituation manifests at the circuit-level, we used whole-brain pERK and 2-photon Ca2+ imaging. These analyses identified 12 classes of neurons that differ in their stimulus response profile, rate of adaptation during learning, anatomical location, and GABAergic identity. By analyzing how GABA and Melatonin alter population activity, we propose a model for dark flash habituation in which the suppression of activity begins early in the visual pathway but downstream of the retina. This suppression is mediated by GABAergic inhibitory motifs resulting in heterogeneous inhibition of distinct neuronal types in the dark flash circuit. Our results have identified multiple molecular pathways acting in functional cell types underlying a form of long-term plasticity in a vertebrate brain, and allow us to propose the first iteration of a model for how and where this learning process is encoded in individual neurons to shape learned behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The meningeal transcriptional response to traumatic brain injury and aging</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that the meningeal compartment plays instrumental roles in various neurological disorders and can modulate neurodevelopment and behavior. While this has sparked great interest in the meninges, we still lack fundamental knowledge about meningeal biology. Here, we utilized high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques to investigate the transcriptional response of the meninges to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and aging in the sub-acute and chronic time frames. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we first explored how mild TBI affects the cellular and transcriptional landscape in the meninges in young mice at one week post-injury. Then, using bulk RNA sequencing, we assessed the differential long-term outcomes between young and aged mice following a TBI. In our scRNA-seq studies, we found that mild head trauma leads to an activation of type I interferon (IFN) signature genes in meningeal macrophages as well as the mobilization of multiple distinct sub-populations of meningeal macrophages expressing hallmarks of either classically activated or wound healing macrophages. We also revealed that dural fibroblasts in the meningeal compartment are highly responsive to TBI, and pathway analysis identified differential expression of genes linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. For reasons that remain poorly understood, the elderly are especially vulnerable to head trauma, where even mild injuries can lead to rapid cognitive decline and devastating neuropathology. To better understand the differential outcomes between the young and the elderly following brain injury, we performed bulk RNA-seq on young and aged meninges from mice that had received a mild TBI or Sham treatment 1.5 months prior. Notably, we found that aging alone induced massive upregulation of meningeal genes involved in antibody production by B cells and type I IFN signaling. Following injury, the meningeal transcriptome had largely returned to its pre-injury signature in young mice. In stark contrast, aged TBI mice still exhibited massive upregulation of immune-related genes and markedly reduced expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and maintenance of cellular junctions. Overall, these findings illustrate the dynamic and complex transcriptional response of the meninges to mild head trauma. Moreover, we also reveal how aging modulates the meningeal response to TBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurochemistry-enriched dynamic causal models of magnetoencephalography, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                We present a hierarchical (i.e., empirical) Bayesian framework for testing hypotheses about synaptic neurotransmission, based on the integration of ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (7T-MRS) and magnetoencephalography. A first level dynamic causal modelling of cortical microcircuits is used to infer the connectivity parameters of a generative model of neurophysiological observations. At the second level, 7T- magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) estimates of regional neurotransmitter concentration supply empirical priors on synaptic connectivity. We compare the evidence for alternative empirical priors, defined by monotonic functions of spectroscopic estimates, on subsets of synaptic connections. For efficiency and reproducibility, we used Bayesian model reduction, parametric empirical Bayes and variational Bayesian inversion. In particular, we used Bayesian model reduction to compare models of how spectroscopic neurotransmitter measures inform estimates of synaptic connectivity. This identifies the synaptic connections that are influenced by neurotransmitter levels, as measured by 7T-MRS . We demonstrate the method using resting-state magnetoencephalography (i.e., task-free recording) and 7T-MRS data from healthy adults. We validate the analysis by split-sampling of the magnetoencephalography dataset. Our results confirm the hypotheses that GABA concentration influences local recurrent inhibitory intrinsic connectivity in deep and superficial cortical layers, while glutamate influences the excitatory connections between superficial and deep layers and connections from superficial to inhibitory interneurons. The method is suitable for applications with magnetoencephalography or electroencephalography, and is well-suited to evince the mechanisms of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including responses to psychopharmacological interventions.

                Dendrites form arbors whose size, shape and complexity define how neurons cover their receptive territories. Actin dynamics contribute to growth and remodelling of dendrite arbors. Here we examined how Spire, a conserved actin nucleation factor, promotes formation of new branches in vivo. In live imaging of Drosophila class IV dendritic arborisation (c4da) neurons, Spire was observed at new sites of branch initiation, where it assembled new actin polymer prior to filopodial outgrowth. For dendrite arborization, Spire required intact structural domains to nucleate actin and target the secretory network, and Spire interacted with Rab11 GTPase, a key regulator of recycling endosomes. Together, these findings support a model that Spire cooperates with Rab11 to promote new dendrite branches by linking localized actin assembly with intracellular trafficking of endosomes that deliver lipids and cargoes to fuel protrusive outgrowth of nascent dendrites.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A unitary model of auditory frequency change perception</a></h4>

              
                Changes in the frequency content of sounds over time are arguably the most basic form of information about the behavior of sound-emitting objects. In perceptual studies, such changes have mostly been investigated separately, as aspects of either pitch or timbre. Here, we propose a unitary account of "up" and "down" subjective judgments of frequency change, based on a model combining auditory correlates of acoustic cues in a sound-specific and listener-specific manner. To do so, we introduce a generalized version of so-called Shepard tones, allowing symmetric manipulations of spectral information on a fine scale, usually associated to pitch (spectral fine structure, SFS), and on a coarse scale, usually associated timbre (spectral envelope, SE). In a series of behavioral experiments, listeners reported "up" or "down" shifts across pairs of generalized Shepard tones that differed in SFS, in SE, or in both. We observed the classic properties of Shepard tones for either SFS or SE shifts: subjective judgements followed the smallest log-frequency change direction, with cases of ambiguity and circularity. Interestingly, when both SFS and SE changes were applied concurrently (synergistically or antagonistically), we observed a trade-off between cues. Listeners were encouraged to report when they perceived "both" directions of change concurrently, but this rarely happened, suggesting a unitary percept. A computational model could accurately fit the behavioral data by combining different cues reflecting frequency changes after auditory filtering. The model revealed that cue weighting depended on the nature of the sound. When presented with harmonic sounds, listeners put more weight on SFS-related cues, whereas inharmonic sounds led to more weight on SE-related cues. Moreover, these stimulus-based factors were modulated by inter-individual differences, revealing variability across listeners in the detailed recipe for "up" and "down" judgments. We argue that frequency changes are tracked perceptually via the adaptive combination of a diverse set of cues, in a manner that is in fact similar to the derivation of other basic auditory dimensions such as spatial location.

                Primary sensory cortices typically display functional topography, suggesting that even small cortical volumes may underpin perception of specific stimuli. Because traditional loss-of-function approaches have a relatively large radius of effect (>1 mm), the behavioral necessity of smaller cortical volumes remains unclear. In the mouse primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1), 'barrels' with a radius of ~150 m receive input predominantly from a single whisker, partitioning vS1 into a topographic map of well- defined columns. Here, we train animals implanted with a cranial window over vS1 to perform single-whisker perceptual tasks. We then use high-power laser exposure centered on the barrel representing the spared whisker to produce lesions with an average volume of ~2 barrels. These columnar scale lesions impair performance on object location discrimination tasks without disrupting vibrissal kinematics. Animals with degraded discrimination performance can immediately perform a detection task with high accuracy. Animals trained de novo on both simple and complex detection tasks showed no behavioral deficits following columnar scale lesions. Thus, vS1 barrels are necessary for performing object location discrimination but not simple or complex object detection

                Decreased cognitive ability is a major consequence of exposure to drugs of abuse, but the underlying neuroplastic changes have been elusive. We show that both phencyclidine and methamphetamine cause a population of prelimbic pyramidal neurons to switch from a glutamatergic to a GABAergic phenotype. Overriding the gain of GABA with RNA-interference prevents drug-induced cognitive deficits and locomotor sensitization, connecting the change in neurotransmitter identity with altered behavior. Chemogenetic suppression of drug-induced hyperactivity also prevents the change in transmitter phenotype or reverses it after it has occurred, preventing or rescuing the associated behavioral changes. These findings may provide therapeutic opportunities to mitigate drug-induced cognitive deficits by manipulating electrical activity in the prelimbic cortex.

                Following exocytosis at active zones, synaptic vesicle membranes and membrane-bound proteins must be recycled. The endocytic machinery that drives this recycling accumulates in the periactive zone (PAZ), a region of the synapse adjacent to active zones, but the organization of this machinery within the PAZ, and how PAZ composition relates to active zone release properties remains unknown. Further, the PAZ is also enriched for cell adhesion proteins, but their function at these sites is poorly understood. Here, using Airyscan and STED imaging of Drosophila synapses, we develop a quantitative framework describing the organization and ultrastructure of the PAZ. Different endocytic proteins localize to distinct regions of the PAZ, suggesting that sub-domains are specialized for distinct biochemical activities, stages of membrane remodeling, or synaptic functions. We find that the accumulation and distribution of endocytic but not adhesion PAZ proteins correlate with the abundance of the scaffolding protein Bruchpilot at active zones - a structural correlate of release probability. These data suggest that endocytic and exocytic activities are spatially correlated. Taken together, our results provide a new approach to quantify synaptic architecture and identify novel relationships between the exocytic and endocytic apparatus at the synapse.

                When the source of nociception expands across a body area, the experience of pain increases due to the spatial integration of nociceptive information. This well-established effect is called spatial summation of pain (SSp) and has been the subject of multiple investigations. Here, we used cold-induced SSp to investigate the effect of attention on the spatial tuning of nociceptive processing. Forty pain-free volunteers (N=40, 20 females) participated in this experiment. They took part in an SSp paradigm based on three hand immersions into cold water: Participants either immersed the ulnar segment (a), radial segment (b) or both hand segments (a+b) and provided overall pain ratings. In some trials based on a+b immersions, they were also asked to provide divided (i.e., first pain in a then in b; or reversed) and directed attention ratings (i.e., pain only in a or b). Results confirmed a clear SSp effect in which reported pain during immersions of a or b was less intense than pain during immersions of a+b (p<0.001). Data also confirmed that spatial tuning was altered. SSp was fully abolished when participants provided two ratings in a divided fashion (p<0.001). Furthermore, pain was significantly lower when attention was directed only to one segment (a OR b) during a+b immersion (p<0.001). We conclude that spatial tuning is dynamically driven by attention as reflected in abolished SSp. Directed attention was sufficient to focus spatial tuning and abolish SSp. Results support the role of cognitive processes such as attention in spatial tuning.

                The cerebellum is involved in learning of fine motor skills, yet whether presynaptic plasticity contributes to such learning remains elusive. Here we report that the EPAC-PKC{varepsilon} module has a critical role in a presynaptic form of long-term potentiation in the cerebellum and motor behavior. Presynaptic cAMP-EPAC-PKC{varepsilon} signaling cascade induces a previously unidentified threonine phosphorylation of RIM1, and thereby initiates the assembly of the Rab3A-RIM1-Munc13-1 tripartite complex that facilitates docking and release of synaptic vesicles. Granule cell-specific blocking of EPAC-PKC{varepsilon} signaling abolishes presynaptic long-term potentiation at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses and impairs basic performance and learning of cerebellar motor behavior. These results unveil a functional relevance of presynaptic plasticity that is regulated through a novel signaling cascade, thereby enriching the spectrum of cerebellar learning mechanisms.

                In the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), gamma oscillations in the local field potential are generated endogenously during odor sampling. Such oscillations arise from dynamical systems that generate organized periodic behavior in neural circuits, and correspond to spike timing constraints at fine timescales. While the cellular and network mechanisms of gamma oscillogenesis in the OB are reasonably well established, it remains unclear how these fine-timescale dynamics serve to represent odors. Are patterns of spike synchrony on the gamma timescale replicable and odor-specific? Does the transformation to a spike-timing metric embed additional computations? To address these questions, we used OB slices to examine the spike timing dynamics evoked by "fictive odorants" generated via spatiotemporally patterned optogenetic stimulation of olfactory sensory neuron axonal arbors. We found that a small proportion of mitral/tufted cells phase-lock strongly to the fast oscillations evoked by fictive odorants, and exhibit tightly coupled spike-spike synchrony on the gamma timescale during this stimulation. Moreover, the specific population of synchronized neurons differed based on the "quality", but not the "concentration", of the fictive odorant presented, and was conserved across multiple presentations of the same fictive odorant. Given the established selectivity of piriform cortical pyramidal neurons for inputs synchronized on this timescale, we conclude that spike synchronization on a milliseconds timescale is a metric by which the OB encodes and exports afferent odor information in a concentration-invariant manner. As a corollary, mitral/tufted cell spikes that are not organized in time may not contribute effectively to the ensemble odor representation.

                Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate marked behavioral improvements during febrile episodes, in what is perhaps the only present-day means of modulating the core ASD phenotype. Understanding the nature of this so-called Fever Effect is therefore essential for leveraging this natural temporary relief of symptoms to a sustained efficacious intervention. Towards this goal, we used machine learning to analyze the rich clinical data of the Simons Simplex Collection, in which 1 out of every 6 children with ASD was reported to improve during febrile episodes, across multiple ASD domains. Reported behavioral improvements during febrile episodes were associated with maternal infection in pregnancy (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = [1.42, 2.03], P = 4.24x10-4) and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction (OR=1.46, 95% CI = [1.15, 1.81], P = 1.94x10-3). Family members of children reported to improve when febrile have an increased prevalence of autoimmune disorders (OR=1.43, 95% CI = [1.23, 1.67], P = 3.0x10-6), language disorders (OR=1.63, 95% CI = [1.29, 2.04], P = 2.5x10-5), and neuropsychiatric disorders (OR=1.59, 95% CI = [1.34, 1.89], P < 1x10-6). Since both GI abnormalities and maternal immune activation have been linked to ASD via proinflammatory cytokines, these results support the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines in the Fever Effect, consistent with findings in mouse models. This work advances our understanding of the fever-responsive ASD subtype and motivates future studies to directly test the link between proinflammatory cytokines and behavioral modifications in individuals with ASD.

                The Mercator projection map of the world provides a useful, but distorted, view of the relative scale of countries. Current cellular models suffer from a similar distortion. Here, we undertook an in-depth structural analysis of the molecular dimensions in the cells computational machinery, the MeshCODE, that is assembled from a meshwork of binary switches in the scaffolding proteins talin and vinculin. Talin contains a series of force-dependent binary switches and each domain switching state introduces quantised step-changes in talin length on a micrometre scale. The average dendritic spine is 1 m in diameter so this analysis identifies a plausible Gearbox-like mechanism for dynamic regulation of synaptic function, whereby the positioning of enzymes and substrates relative to each other, mechanically-encoded by the MeshCODE switch patterns, might control synaptic transmission. Based on biophysical rules and experimentally derived distances, this analysis yields a novel perspective on biological digital information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic top-down biasing implements rapid adaptive changes to individual movements</a></h4>

              
                Complex behaviors depend on the coordinated activity of neural ensembles in interconnected brain areas. The behavioral function of such coordination, often measured as co-fluctuations in neural activity across areas, is poorly understood. One hypothesis is that rapidly varying co-fluctuations may be a signature of moment-by-moment task-relevant influences of one area on another. We tested this possibility for error-corrective adaptation of birdsong, a form of motor learning which has been hypothesized to depend on the top-down influence of a higher-order area, LMAN, in shaping moment-by-moment output from a primary motor area, RA. In paired recordings of LMAN and RA in singing birds, we discovered a neural signature of a top-down influence of LMAN on RA, quantified as an LMAN-leading co-fluctuation between these areas. During learning, this co-fluctuation strengthened in a premotor temporal window linked to the specific movement, sequential context, and acoustic modification associated with learning. Moreover, transient perturbation of LMAN activity specifically within this premotor window caused rapid occlusion of pitch modifications, consistent with LMAN conveying a temporally localized motor-biasing signal. Combined, our results reveal a dynamic top-down influence of LMAN on RA that varies on the rapid timescale of individual movements and is flexibly linked to contexts associated with learning. This finding indicates that inter-area co-fluctuations can be a signature of dynamic top-down influences that support complex behavior and its adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vulnerable Brain Networks Associated with Risk for Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Brain connectomes provide untapped potential for identifying individuals at risk for Alzheimers disease (AD), and can help provide novel targets based on selective circuit vulnerability. Age, APOE4 genotype, and female sex are thought to contribute to the selective vulnerability of brain networks in Alzheimers disease, in a manner that differentiates pathological versus normal aging. These brain networks may predict pathology otherwise hard to detect, decades before overt disease manifestation and cognitive decline. Uncovering network based biomarkers at prodromal, asymptomatic stages may offer new windows of opportunity for interventions, either therapeutic or preventive. We used a sample of 72 people across the age span to model the relationship between Alzheimers disease risk and vulnerable brain networks. Sparse Canonical Correlation analysis (SCCA) revealed relationships between brain subgraphs and AD risk, with bootstrap based confidence intervals. When constructing a composite AD risk factor based on sex, age, genotype, the highest weight was associated with genotype. Next, we mapped networks associated with auditory, visual, and olfactory memory, and identified networks extending beyond the main nodes known to be involved in these functions. The inclusion of cognitive metrics in a composite risk factor pointed to vulnerable networks, and associated with the specific memory tests. These regions with the highest cumulative degree of connectivity in our studies were the pericalcarine, insula, banks of the superior sulcus and cerebellum. To help scale up our approach, we extended Tensor Network Principal Component Analysis (TNPCA) to evaluate AD risk related subgraphs, introducing CCA components and sparsity. When constructing a composite AD risk factor based on sex, age, and genotype, and family risk factor the most significant risk was associated with age. Our sparse regression based predictive models revealed vulnerable networks associated with known risk factors. The prediction error was 17% for genotype, 24% for family risk factor, and 5 years for age. Age prediction in groups including MCI and AD subjects involved several regions that were not prominent for age prediction otherwise. These regions included the middle and transverse temporal, paracentral and superior banks of temporal sulcus, as well as the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. The joint estimation of AD risk and connectome based mappings involved the cuneus, temporal, and cingulate cortices known to be associated with AD, and add new candidates, such as the cerebellum, whose role in AD is to be understood. Our predictive modeling approaches for AD risk factors represent a stepping stone towards single subject prediction, based on distances from normative graphs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early and lifelong effects of APOE4 on neuronal gene expression networks relevant to Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype and aging are critical risk factors for Alzheimers disease (AD). Aged APOE4 knock-in (APOE4-KI) mice have phenotypes reflecting features of AD. We conducted a large-scale single nucleus RNA-sequencing study to identify cell-type-specific effects of APOE4 on hippocampal gene expression during aging. APOE4-KI mice showed prominent alterations, relative to APOE3-KI mice, in neuronal transcriptome related to synaptic function, calcium signaling, and MAPK/Rap1/Pld signal transduction, starting by 5 months and persisting during aging. Mice with the APOE4 gene removed specifically from neurons failed to show most of these neuronal transcriptomic changes, suggesting a specific effect of neuron-derived APOE4 on the transcriptome. APOE4 affects similar cellular pathways in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human neurons transplanted into APOE4-KI mouse hippocampus and in cortical neurons from aged human brains. Thus, neuronal APOE4 has early and persistent effects on neuronal transcriptomes, suggesting the requirement of early interventions for successfully treating APOE4-related AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multivariate brain signature for reward</a></h4>

              
                The processing of rewards and losses are crucial for learning to adapt to an ever changing environment. Dysregulated reward processes are prevalent in mental health and substance use disorders. While many human brain measures related to reward have been based on activity in individual brain regions, recent studies indicate that many affective and motivational processes are encoded in distributed systems that span multiple regions. Consequently, decoding these processes using individual regions yields small effect sizes and limited reliability, whereas predictive models based on distributed patterns yield much larger effect sizes and excellent reliability. To create such a predictive model for the processes of rewards and losses, from now on termed the Brain Reward Signature (BRS), we trained a LASSO-PCR model to predict the signed magnitude of monetary rewards and losses on the Monetary Incentive Delay task (MID; N = 39) and achieved a high significant decoding performance (92% for decoding rewards versus losses). We subsequently demonstrate the generalizability of our signature on another version of the MID in a different sample (92% decoding accuracy for rewards versus losses; N = 12) and on a gambling task from a large sample (73% decoding accuracy for rewards versus losses, N = 1084) from the Human Connectome Project. Lastly, we also provided preliminary evidence for specificity to rewarding outcomes by illustrating that the signature map generates estimates that significantly differ between rewarding and negative feedback (92% decoding accuracy) but do not differ for conditions that differ in disgust rather than reward in a novel Disgust-Delay Task (N = 39). We thus created a BRS that can be used to make specific, generalizable and reproducible predictions about brain responses to rewards and losses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-Controlled Electrical Stimulation Restores Continuous Finger Function</a></h4>

              
                Brain-machine interfaces have shown promise in extracting upper extremity movement intention from the thoughts of nonhuman primates and people with tetraplegia. Attempts to restore a user's own hand and arm function have employed functional electrical stimulation (FES), but most work has restored discrete grasps. Little is known about how well FES can control continuous finger movements. Here, we use a low-power brain-controlled functional electrical stimulation (BCFES) system to restore continuous volitional control of finger positions to a monkey with a temporarily paralyzed hand. In a one-dimensional, continuous, finger-related target acquisition task, the monkey improved his success rate to 83% (1.5s median acquisition time) when using the BCFES system during temporary paralysis from 8.8% (9.5s median acquisition, equivalent to chance) when attempting to use his temporarily paralyzed hand. With two monkeys under general anesthesia, we found FES alone could control the monkeys' fingers to rapidly reach targets in a median 1.1s but caused oscillation about the target. Finally, when attempting to perform a virtual two-finger continuous target acquisition task in brain-control mode following temporary hand paralysis, we found performance could be completely recovered by executing recalibrated feedback-intention training one time following temporary paralysis. These results suggest that BCFES can restore continuous finger function during temporary paralysis using existing low-power technologies and brain-control may not be the limiting performance factor in a BCFES neuroprosthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early-Life Stress Impairs Perception and Neural Encoding of Rapid Signals in the Auditory Pathway</a></h4>

              
                In children, early ear infections are a risk factor for later speech perception deficits. This is likely because auditory deprivation during a developmental critical period (CP) induces long-lasting deficits in perception and ACx encoding of temporally-varying sounds. CPs also create susceptibility to early-life stress (ELS) in neural regions involved with cognition and anxiety. As CP mechanisms are shared by sensory cortices and higher neural regions, ACx and temporal encoding may also be susceptible to ELS. To examine the effects of ELS on temporal processing, we developed a model of ELS in the Mongolian gerbil, a well-established model for auditory processing. ELS induction impaired the behavioral detection of short gaps in sound, which are critical for speech perception. This was accompanied by reduced neural responses to gaps in ACx, the auditory periphery, and auditory brainstem. These ELS effects presumably degrade the fidelity of sensory representations available to higher regions, and could contribute to ELS-induced problems with cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-specific age-related changes in excitatory and inhibitory intra-cortical circuits in mouse primary auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                A common impairment in aging is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis), which manifests as impaired spectrotemporal processing. Aging is accompanied by alteration in normal inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission and changes in excitatory (NMDA and AMPA) synapses in the auditory cortex (ACtx). However, the circuit mechanisms responsible for age-related auditory dysfunction remain unknown. Here we investigated how auditory cortical microcircuits change with age. We performed laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) combined with whole-cell patch clamp recordings from Layer (L) 2/3 cells in primary auditory cortex (A1) in young adult (postnatal day (P) 47-P72) and aged (P543 to P626) male and female CBA/CaJ mice. We found that L2/3 cells in aged male animals display functional hypoconnectivity of both excitatory and inhibitory circuits originating from L4. Compared to cells from young adult mice, cells from aged male mice have fewer inhibitory connections from L4 while female mice show weaker connection strength. These results suggest a sex-specific reduction in excitatory and inhibitory intralaminar cortical circuits in aged mice compared with young adult animals. We speculate that these unbalanced changes in cortical circuits contribute to the functional manifestations of age-related hearing loss in both males and females.

                As information about the world is conveyed from the sensory periphery to central neural circuits, it mixes with complex ongoing cortical activity. How do neural populations keep track of sensory signals, separating them from noisy ongoing activity? Here we show that sensory signals are encoded more reliably, with less noise in certain low-dimensional subspaces. These coding subspaces are defined by correlations between simultaneously recorded neural activity in primary sensory cortex and upstream sensory brain regions; the most correlated dimensions were best for decoding. We analytically predicted and experimentally confirmed that coding subspaces can be further improved when defined based on populations with lower noise correlations between cortex and upstream regions. We show that this principle generalizes across diverse sensory stimuli in the olfactory system and the visual system of awake mice. Our results suggest the cortex may multiplex different functions by executing them in different low dimensional subspaces.

                Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is fundamental to neuroscience, where detailed structural brain scans improve clinical diagnoses and provide accurate neuroanatomical information. Apart from time-consuming scanning protocols, higher image resolution can be obtained with super resolution algorithms. We investigated the generalization abilities of Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (SRGANs) across different populations. T1-weighted scans from three large cohorts were used, spanning older subjects, newborns, and patients with brain tumor- or treatment-induced tissue changes. Upsampling quality was validated using synthetic and anatomical metrics. Models were first trained on each cohort, yielding high image quality and anatomical fidelity. When applied across cohorts, no artifacts were introduced by the SRGANs. SRGANs that were trained on a dataset combining all cohorts also did not induce any population-based artifacts. We showed that SRGANs provide a prime example of robust AI, where application on unseen populations did not introduce artifacts due to training data bias (e.g., insertion or removal of tumor-related signals and contrast inversion). This is an important step in the deployment of SRGANs in real-world settings.

                In the present paper we propose a non-parametric statistical test procedure for interval scaled, paired samples data that circumvents the multiple comparison problem (MCP) by relating the data to the rank order of its group averages. Using an auto-regressive procedure, a single test statistic for multiple groups is obtained that allows for qualitative statements about whether multiple group averages are in fact different and how they can be sorted. The presented procedure outperforms classical tests, such as pairwise conducted t-tests and ANOVA, in some circumstances. Furthermore, the test is robust against noise and does not require the data to follow any particular distribution. If A is a data matrix containing N observations for k groups, then the test statistic {eta} can be computed by {eta} = {sum}f(Ai,s)/N, where s is a vector of length k containing the average for each group, transformed into unique rank values. This statistic is compared to the distribution D, obtained by Monte Carlo sampling from the permutation distribution. It will be demonstrated that D can be described by a normal distribution for a variety of input data distributions and choices for f, as long as a set of criteria is met. Comparing {eta} to the permutation distribution controls the false alarm (FA) rate sufficiently, since the exact p-value can be estimated. Multiple examples of possible choices for f will be discussed, as well as detailed descriptions of the underlying test assumptions, possible interpretations and use cases. All mathematical derivations are supported with a set of simulations, written in Python that can be downloaded from https://gitlab.com/TommyClausner/aros-test together with an implementation of the test itself.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Validation of a new coil array tailored for dog functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies</a></h4>

              
                Comparative neuroimaging allows for the identification of similarities and differences between species. It provides an important and promising avenue, to answer questions about the evolutionary origins of the brain's organization, in terms of both structure and function. Dog fMRI has recently become one particularly promising and increasingly used approach to study brain function and coevolution. In dog neuroimaging, image acquisition has so far been mostly performed with coils originally developed for use in human MRI. Since such coils have been tailored to human anatomy, their sensitivity and data quality is likely not optimal for dog MRI. Therefore, we developed a multi-channel receive coil (K9 coil) tailored for high-resolution functional imaging in canines, optimized for dog cranial anatomy. In this paper we report structural (n = 9) as well as functional imaging data (resting-state, n = 6; simple visual paradigm, n = 9) collected with the K9 coil in comparison to reference data collected with a human knee coil. Our results show that the K9 coil significantly outperforms the human knee coil, improving the signal-to-noise ratio across the imaging modalities. We noted increases of roughly 45% signal-to-noise in the structural and functional domain. In terms of translation to functional fMRI data collected in a visual flickering checkerboard paradigm, group-level analyses show that the K9 coil performs better than the knee coil as well. These findings demonstrate how hardware improvements may be instrumental in driving data quality, and thus, quality of imaging results, for dog-human comparative neuroimaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beta oscillations and waves in motor cortex can be accounted for by the interplay of spatially-structured connectivity and fluctuating inputs</a></h4>

              
                The beta rhythm (13-30 Hz) is a prominent brain rhythm. Recordings in primates during instructed-delay reaching tasks have shown that different types of traveling waves of oscillatory activity are associated with episodes of beta oscillations in motor cortex during movement preparation. We propose here a simple model of motor cortex based on local excitatory-inhibitory neuronal populations coupled by longer range excitation, where additionally inputs to the motor cortex from other neural structures are represented by stochastic inputs on the different model populations. We show that the model accurately reproduces the statistics of recording data when these external inputs are correlated on a short time scale (25 ms) and have two different components, one that targets the motor cortex locally and another one that targets it in a global and synchronized way. The model reproduces the distribution of beta burst durations, the proportion of the different observed wave types, and wave speeds, which we show not to be linked to axonal propagation speed. When the long-range connectivity is anisotropic, traveling waves are found to preferentially propagate along the axis where connectivity decays the fastest. Different from previously proposed mechanistic explanations, the model suggests that traveling waves in motor cortex are the reflection of the dephasing by external inputs, putatively of thalamic origin, of an os- cillatory activity that would otherwise be spatially synchronized by recurrent connectivity.

                We present an integrative proteomic strategy for the nomination and validation of proteins associated with cognitive resilience to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Correlation network analysis across distinct stages of AD was used to prioritize protein modules linked to resilience. Neuritin (NRN1), a hub protein in a module associated with synaptic biology, was identified as a top candidate of resilience and selected for functional validation in cultured neurons. NRN1 provided dendritic spine resilience against amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), and NRN1 blocked A{beta}-induced neuronal hyperexcitability. The impact of exogenous NRN1 on the proteome of cultured neurons was assessed and integrated with the AD brain network. This revealed over-lapping synapse-related biology that linked NRN1-induced changes in cultured neurons with human pathways associated with AD resilience. Collectively, this highlights the utility of integrating the proteome from human brain and model systems to prioritize therapeutic targets that mediate resilience to AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal monitoring of human cortical organoids implanted in mice using transparent graphene microelectrodes reveal functional connection between organoid and mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Human cortical organoids, three-dimensional neuronal cell cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, have recently emerged as promising models of human brain development and dysfunction. Transplantation of human brain organoids into the mouse brain has been shown to be a successful in vivo model providing vascularization for long term chronic experiments. However, chronic functional connectivity and responses evoked by external sensory stimuli has yet to be demonstrated, due to limitations of chronic recording technologies. Here, we develop an experimental paradigm based on transparent graphene microelectrode arrays and two-photon imaging for longitudinal, multimodal monitoring of human organoids transplanted in the mouse cortex. The transparency of graphene microelectrodes permits visual and optical inspection of the transplanted organoid and the surrounding cortex throughout the chronic experiments where local field potentials and multi-unit activity (MUA) are recorded during spontaneous activity and visual stimuli. These experiments reveal that visual stimuli evoke electrophysiological responses in the organoid, matching the responses from the surrounding cortex. Increases in the power of the gamma and MUA bands as well as phase locking of MUA events to slow oscillations evoked by visual stimuli suggest functional connectivity established between the human and mouse tissue. Optical imaging through the transparent microelectrodes shows vascularization of the organoids. Postmortem histological analysis exhibits morphological integration and synaptic connectivity with surrounding mouse cortex as well as migration of organoid cells into the surrounding cortex. This novel combination of stem cell and neural recording technologies could serve as a unique platform for comprehensive evaluation of organoids as models of brain development and dysfunction and as personalized neural prosthetics to restore lost, degenerated, or damaged brain regions.

                Performing endovascular medical interventions safely and efficiently requires a diverse set of skills that need to be practised in dedicated training sessions. Here, we used multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to determine the structural and functional plasticity and core skills associated with skill acquisition. A training group learned to perform a simulator-based endovascular procedure, while a control group performed a simplified version of the task; multimodal MR images were acquired before and after training. Using a well-controlled interaction design, we found strong, multimodal evidence for the role of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in endovascular skill acquisition that is in line with previous work implicating the structure in simple visuo-motor and mental rotation tasks. Our results provide a unique window into the multimodal nature of rapid structural and functional plasticity of the human brain while learning a multifaceted and complex clinical skill. Further, our results provide a detailed description of the plasticity process associated with endovascular skill acquisition and highlight specific facets of skills that could enhance current medical pedagogy and be useful to explicitly target during clinical resident training.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Restoring synapse integrity and memory in Alzheimer's disease by downregulation of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3</a></h4>

              
                Increasing evidence supports a role of deficient Wnt signaling in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies reveal that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) is elevated in the human AD brain. Here, we investigate the contribution of DKK3 to synapse integrity in the healthy and AD brain. We uncover a novel genetic link between DKK3 gene variants and AD risk. Our findings show that DKK3 protein is increased in different human brain fractions consistent with disease progression. In the hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F AD models, DKK3 accumulates at plaques in the brain. Oligomers of amyloid-beta enhance the secretion of DKK3 from cultured neurons and DKK3 secretion is also increased in hippocampal slices of hAPP-J20 mice. In addition, gain-of-function experiments revealed that DKK3 decreases the density of excitatory synapses through inhibition of the canonical Wnt/GSK3beta pathway but increases inhibitory synapse density through activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. Our studies demonstrate that in vivo DKK3 downregulation restores synapse number in hAPP-J20 mice. Importantly, DKK3 knockdown improves memory in this AD model. Collectively, our findings identify DKK3 as a novel driver of synapse defects and memory impairment in AD.

	<p>An embryo&amp;amp;rsquo;s in-utero exposure to ethanol due to a mother&amp;amp;rsquo;s alcohol drinking results in a range of deficits in the child that are collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Prenatal ethanol exposure is one of the leading causes of preventable intellectual disability. Its neurobehavioral underpinnings warrant systematic research. We investigated the immediate effects on embryos of acute prenatal ethanol exposure during gestational days (GDs) and the influence of such exposure on persistent neurobehavioral deficits in adult offspring. We administered pregnant C57BL/6J mice with ethanol (1.75 g/kg) (GDE) or saline (GDS) intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 0 h and again at 2 h intervals on GD 8 and GD 12. Subsequently, we assessed apoptosis, differentiation, and signaling events in embryo forebrains (E13.5; GD13.5). Long-lasting effects of GDE were evaluated via a behavioral test battery. We also determined the long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity-related protein expression in adult hippocampal tissue. GDE caused apoptosis, inhibited differentiation, and reduced pERK and pCREB signaling and the expression of transcription factors Pax6 and Lhx2. GDE caused persistent spatial and social investigation memory deficits compared with saline controls, regardless of sex. Interestingly, GDE adult mice exhibited enhanced repetitive and anxiety-like behavior, irrespective of sex. GDE reduced synaptic plasticity-related protein expression and caused hippocampal synaptic plasticity (LTP and LTD) deficits in adult offspring. These findings demonstrate that binge-like ethanol exposure at the GD8 and GD12 developmental stages causes defects in pERK&amp;amp;ndash;pCREB signaling and reduces the expression of Pax6 and Lhx2, leading to impaired cellular differentiation during the embryonic stage. In the adult stage, binge-like ethanol exposure caused persistent synaptic and behavioral abnormalities in adult mice. Furthermore, the findings suggest that combining ethanol exposure at two sensitive stages (GD8 and GD12) causes deficits in synaptic plasticity-associated proteins (Arc, Egr1, Fgf1, GluR1, and GluN1), leading to persistent FASD-like neurobehavioral deficits in mice.</p>

	<p>Brain tumor semantic segmentation is a critical medical image processing work, which aids clinicians in diagnosing patients and determining the extent of lesions. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in computer vision tasks in recent years. For 3D medical image tasks, deep convolutional neural networks based on an encoder&amp;amp;ndash;decoder structure and skip-connection have been frequently used. However, CNNs have the drawback of being unable to learn global and remote semantic information well. On the other hand, the transformer has recently found success in natural language processing and computer vision as a result of its usage of a self-attention mechanism for global information modeling. For demanding prediction tasks, such as 3D medical picture segmentation, local and global characteristics are critical. We propose SwinBTS, a new 3D medical picture segmentation approach, which combines a transformer, convolutional neural network, and encoder&amp;amp;ndash;decoder structure to define the 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation job as a sequence-to-sequence prediction challenge in this research. To extract contextual data, the 3D Swin Transformer is utilized as the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s encoder and decoder, and convolutional operations are employed for upsampling and downsampling. Finally, we achieve segmentation results using an improved Transformer module that we built for increasing detail feature extraction. Extensive experimental results on the BraTS 2019, BraTS 2020, and BraTS 2021 datasets reveal that SwinBTS outperforms state-of-the-art 3D algorithms for brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scanned images.</p>

	<p>Maintaining normal gonadal axis hormone levels is important for improving the condition of male patients with pituitary adenoma. The current literature is somewhat divided on the results of evaluations of gonadal axis function in male patients with pituitary adenoma before and after treatment, and the increasing demand for better quality of life has provided motivation for this research to continue. In this article, we summarize the feasibility of using testosterone as an indicator for assessing male function and discuss the changes reported in various studies for gonadal hormones before and after treatment in male patients with pituitary adenoma. It is important for clinicians to understand the advantages of each treatment option and the effectiveness of assessing gonadal function. The rationale behind the theory that pituitary adenomas affect gonadal function and the criteria for evaluating pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;gonadal axis hormones should be explored in more depth.</p>

	<p>Risky decision-making (RDM) is when individuals make choices based on the definite cognition for the probabilities of the options. Risk is embodied in the certainty of reward, and the smaller the probability is, the greater the risk will be. As simulated in human behavior paradigms, RDM scenarios in real life are often guided by external cues that inform the likelihood of receiving certain rewards. There are few studies on the neural basis of RDM behavior guided by external cues, which is related to the relative paucity of the animal behavioral paradigms. Here, we established a cue-guided RDM task to detect the behavior of rats making a decision between a small certain reward and a large uncertain reward in a naturalistic manner. The reward of the risk option could be adjusted to observe the change of choice. Our results showed that: (1) rats were able to master the operation of the cue-guided RDM task; (2) many rats were inclined to choose risk rather than the safe option when the reward expectations were equal; (3) rats were able to adjust the decision strategy in time upon a change in risk, suggesting that they have the ability to perceive risk indicated by the external cues.</p>

	<p>Research on sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) based on neurofeedback (NFb) emphasizes improvements in selective attention associated with SMR amplification. However, the long-term training proposed in most studies posed the question of acceptability, which led to the evaluation of the potential of a single NFb session. Based on cognitive and autonomic controls interfering with attention processes, we hypothesized changes in selective attention after a single SMR-NFb session, along with changes in brain&amp;amp;ndash;heart interplay, which are reflected in the multifractality of heartbeat dynamics. Here, young healthy participants (n = 35, 20 females, 21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3 years) were randomly assigned either to a control group (Ctrl) watching a movie or to a neurofeedback (NFb) group performing a single session of SMR-NFb. A headset with EEG electrodes (positioned on C3 and C4) connected to a smartphone app served to guide and to evaluate NFb training efficacy. A Stroop task was performed for 8 min by each group before and after the intervention (movie vs. SMR-NFb) while collecting heart rate variability and C4-EEG for 20 min. When compared to Ctrl, the NFb group exhibited better Stroop performance, especially when facing incongruent trials. The multifractality and NFb training efficacy were identified as strong predictors of the gain in global Stroop performance, while multifractality was the only predictor regarding incongruent trials. We conclude that a single session of SMR-NFb improves selective attention in healthy individuals through the specific reorganization of brain&amp;amp;ndash;heart interplay, which is reflected in multifractal heartbeat dynamics.</p>

                <p>This exploratory case–control study investigates the synaptic marker beta-synuclein in serum and plasma pTau181 in adults with Down syndrome (DS) with (sDS, <i>n</i> = 14) and without (aDS, <i>n</i> = 47) clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) as well as euploid controls (<i>n</i> = 23). Beta-synuclein was higher in aDS and more pronounced in sDS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), whereas pTau181 was only higher in sDS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Both markers showed good discriminatory power (area under the curve &gt; 0.90) to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic AD. The data indicate that synaptic alterations belong to the earliest AD-associated events in DS and highlight the value of serum beta-synuclein as a potential early marker of AD.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">An Integrated Phenotypic and Genotypic Approach Reveals a High‐Risk Subtype Association for EBF3 Missense Variants Affecting the Zinc Finger Domain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Collier/Olf/EBF (COE) transcription factors have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature nervous system. To date, a neurological disease association has been conclusively established for only the <i>Early B-cell Factor-3</i> (<i>EBF3</i>) COE family member through the identification of heterozygous loss-of-function variants in individuals with autism spectrum/neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Here, we identify a symptom severity risk association with missense variants primarily disrupting the zinc finger domain (ZNF) in <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A phenotypic assessment of 41 individuals was combined with a literature meta-analysis for a total of 83 individuals diagnosed with <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD. Quantitative diagnostic phenotypic and symptom severity scales were developed to compare <i>EBF3</i> variant type and location to identify genotype–phenotype correlations. To stratify the effects of <i>EBF3</i> variants disrupting either the DNA-binding domain (DBD) or the ZNF, we used <i>in vivo</i> fruit fly UAS-GAL4 expression and <i>in vitro</i> luciferase assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that patient symptom severity correlates with <i>EBF3</i> missense variants perturbing the ZNF, which is a key protein domain required for stabilizing the interaction between EBF3 and the target DNA sequence. We found that ZNF-associated variants failed to restore viability in the fruit fly and impaired transcriptional activation. However, the recurrent variant EBF3 p.Arg209Trp in the DBD is capable of partially rescuing viability in the fly and preserved transcriptional activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We describe a symptom severity risk association with ZNF perturbations and EBF3 loss-of-function in the largest reported cohort to date of EBF3-related NDD patients. This analysis should have potential predictive clinical value for newly identified patients with <i>EBF3</i> gene variants. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:138–153</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association of Apolipoprotein E ɛ4 Allele with Enlarged Perivascular Spaces</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Enlarged perivascular spaces have emerged as markers of cerebral small vessel disease and are linked to perivascular drainage dysfunction. The apolipoprotein E-ɛ4 (APOE-ɛ4) allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's neuropathology, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We studied the relationship between APOE-ɛ4 and the topography and burden of enlarged perivascular spaces to elucidate underlying mechanisms between APOE-ɛ4 and adverse clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 3,564 Framingham Heart Study participants with available genotypes and magnetic resonance imaging. Enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale were rated using a validated scale. We related APOE-ɛ4 allele presence to high burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in each region and a mixed score reflecting high burden in both regions using multivariable logistic regression. Exploratory analyses incorporated presence of cerebral microbleeds and assessed effect modification by hypertension.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean age was 60.7 years (SD = 14.6), 1,644 (46.1%) were men, 1,486 (41.8%) were hypertensive, and 836 (23.5%) participants were APOE-ɛ4 carriers. APOE-ɛ4 was associated with high burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16, 1.81) and mixed regions (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.68). Associations were slightly stronger in hypertensive subjects.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The APOE-ɛ4 allele plays a modest role in the burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying small vessel disease type in community-dwelling individuals with predominant centrum semiovale enlarged perivascular spaces, which may be hypertensive angiopathy in our sample.

                <p>Ophelia syndrome or encephalitis with antibodies against the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) manifests with behavioral changes, memory deficits, and anxiety. To study the antibody pathogenicity, mice received continuous cerebroventricular infusion of patients' or controls' immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 14 days, followed by a 15-day washout. The effects on hippocampal mGluR5 clusters were determined by confocal microscopy. Animals infused with patients' IgG, but not controls' IgG, showed memory impairment, increased anxiety, and decreased neuronal surface mGluR5 clusters. After antibody clearance, both behavioral and molecular changes reversed to baseline conditions. These findings support the pathogenicity of these antibodies in anti-mGluR5 encephalitis.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Inequities in Therapy for Infantile Spasms: A Call to Action</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine whether selection of treatment for children with infantile spasms (IS) varies by race/ethnicity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The prospective US National Infantile Spasms Consortium database includes children with IS treated from 2012 to 2018. We examined the relationship between race/ethnicity and receipt of standard IS therapy (prednisolone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, vigabatrin), adjusting for demographic and clinical variables using logistic regression. Our primary outcome was <i>treatment course</i>, which considered therapy prescribed for the first and, when needed, the second IS treatment together.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 555 children, 324 (58%) were non-Hispanic white, 55 (10%) non-Hispanic Black, 24 (4%) non-Hispanic Asian, 80 (14%) Hispanic, and 72 (13%) other/unknown. Most (398, 72%) received a standard treatment course. Insurance type, geographic location, history of prematurity, prior seizures, developmental delay or regression, abnormal head circumference, hypsarrhythmia, and IS etiologies were associated with standard therapy. In adjusted models, non-Hispanic Black children had lower odds of receiving a standard treatment course compared with non-Hispanic white children (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20–0.89; <i>p</i> = 0.02). Adjusted models also showed that children with public (vs. private) insurance had lower odds of receiving standard therapy for treatment 1 (OR, 0.42; CI, 0.21–0.84; <i>p</i> = 0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Non-Hispanic Black children were more often treated with non-standard IS therapies than non-Hispanic white children. Likewise, children with public (vs. private) insurance were less likely to receive standard therapies. Investigating drivers of inequities, and understanding the impact of racism on treatment decisions, are critical next steps to improve care for patients with IS.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are characterized by genetic heterogeneity. Some mapped and named <i>loci</i> remain without a causal gene identified. Here we applied next generation sequencing (NGS) to uncover the genetic etiology of the <i>SCA25 locus</i>.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing were performed in families linked to <i>SCA25</i>, including the French family in which the <i>SCA25 locus</i> was originally mapped. Whole exome sequence data were interrogated in a cohort of 796 ataxia patients of unknown etiology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SCA25 phenotype spans a slowly evolving sensory and cerebellar ataxia, in most cases attributed to ganglionopathy. A pathogenic variant causing exon skipping was identified in the gene encoding Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase PNPase 1 (<i>PNPT1)</i> located in the <i>SCA25</i> linkage interval. A second splice variant in <i>PNPT1</i> was detected in a large Australian family with a dominant ataxia also mapping to <i>SCA25</i>. An additional nonsense variant was detected in an unrelated individual with ataxia. Both nonsense and splice heterozygous variants result in premature stop codons, all located in the S1-domain of PNPase. In addition, an elevated type I interferon response was observed in blood from all affected heterozygous carriers tested. PNPase notably prevents the abnormal accumulation of double-stranded mtRNAs in the mitochondria and leakage into the cytoplasm, associated with triggering a type I interferon response.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identifies <i>PNPT1</i> as a new SCA gene, responsible for SCA25, and highlights biological links between alterations of mtRNA trafficking, interferonopathies and ataxia. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:122–137</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The Optimal Target and Connectivity for Deep Brain Stimulation in Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can reduce seizures in Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS). However, little is known about the optimal target and whether efficacy depends on connectivity of the stimulation site. Using outcome data from the ESTEL trial, we aimed to determine the optimal target and connectivity for DBS in LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 20 patients underwent bilateral DBS of the thalamic centromedian nucleus (CM). Outcome was percentage seizure reduction from baseline after 3 months of DBS, defined using three measures (monthly seizure diaries, 24-hour scalp electroencephalography [EEG], and a novel diary-EEG composite). Probabilistic stimulation mapping identified thalamic locations associated with higher/lower efficacy. Two substitute diffusion MRI datasets (a normative dataset from healthy subjects and a “disease-matched” dataset from a separate group of LGS patients) were used to calculate structural connectivity between DBS sites and a map of areas known to express epileptic activity in LGS, derived from our previous EEG-fMRI research.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Results were similar across the three outcome measures. Stimulation was most efficacious in the anterior and inferolateral “parvocellular” CM border, extending into the ventral lateral nucleus (posterior subdivision). There was a positive association between diary-EEG composite seizure reduction and connectivity to areas of <i>a priori</i> EEG-fMRI activation, including premotor and prefrontal cortex, putamen, and pontine brainstem. In contrast, outcomes were not associated with baseline clinical variables.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Efficacious CM-DBS for LGS is linked to stimulation of the parvocellular CM and the adjacent ventral lateral nucleus, and is associated with connectivity to, and thus likely modulation of, the “secondary epileptic network” underlying the shared electroclinical manifestations of LGS.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Early Predictors of Clinical and MRI Outcomes Using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to identify predictors in common between different clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing predictive models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 704 patients from our center seen at MS onset, measuring 37 baseline demographic, clinical, treatment, and MRI predictors, and 10-year outcomes. Our primary aim was identifying predictors in common among clinical outcomes: aggressive MS, benign MS, and secondary-progressive (SP)MS. We also investigated MRI outcomes: T2 lesion volume (T2LV) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). The performance of the full 37-predictor model was compared with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-selected model of predictors in common between each outcome by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The full 37-predictor model was highly predictive of clinical outcomes: in-sample AUC was 0.91 for aggressive MS, 0.81 for benign MS, and 0.81 for SPMS. After variable selection, 10 LASSO-selected predictors were in common between each clinical outcome: age, Expanded Disability Status Scale, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory and bowel/bladder signs, timed 25-foot walk ≥6 seconds, poor attack recovery, no sensory attacks, and time-to-treatment. This reduced model had comparable cross-validation AUC as the full 37-predictor model: 0.84 versus 0.81 for aggressive MS, 0.75 versus 0.73 for benign MS, and 0.76 versus 0.75 for SPMS, respectively. In contrast, 10-year MRI outcomes were more strongly influenced by initial T2LV and BPF than clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Early prognostication of MS is possible using LASSO modeling to identify a limited set of accessible clinical features. These predictive models can be clinically usable in treatment decision making once implemented into web-based calculators. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:87–96</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The motor severity in Parkinson disease (PD) is believed to parallel dopaminergic terminal degeneration in the striatum, although the terminal was reported to be virtually absent by 4 years postdiagnosis. Meanwhile, neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra (SN) elucidated a variability at early stages and gradual loss with less variability 10 years postdiagnosis. Here, we aimed to clarify the correlation between motor impairments and striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration and nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss at early to advanced stages of PD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ninety-three PD patients were divided into early and advanced subgroups based on motor symptom duration and whether motor fluctuation was present. Striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration was evaluated using a presynaptic dopamine transporter tracer, <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron density was assessed by neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In patients with early stage PD (motor symptoms for ≤8 or 10 years), motor dysfunction during the drug-off state was paralleled by a decline in <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum despite the absence of a correlation with reductions in NM-MRI signals in SN. Meanwhile, in patients with advanced stage PD (motor symptoms for &gt;8 or 10 years and with fluctuation), the degree of motor deficits during the drug-off state was not correlated with <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum, despite its significant negative correlation with NM-MRI signals in SN.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose striatal dopaminergic terminal loss measured using <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT and nigral dopamine neuron loss assessed with NM-MRI as early stage and advanced stage motor impairment biomarkers, respectively. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:110–121</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of endovascular therapy (EVT) versus intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO), based on the information of advanced imaging.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data of stroke patients with radiologically confirmed BAO within 24 hours. BAO subjects were categorized into “top-of-the-basilar” syndrome (TOBS) and other types. An initial infarct size of &lt;70ml and a ratio of ischemic tissue to infarct volume of ≥1.8 was defined as “target mismatch.” The primary outcome was a good outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3 at 3 months. Propensity score adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity score methods were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 474 BAO patients, 93 (19.6%) were treated with IVT prior to EVT, 91 (19.2%) were treated with IVT alone, 95 (20.0%) were treated with EVT alone, and 195 (41.1%) were treated with antithrombotic therapy. In IPTW analyses, we found no benefit of EVT over IVT for good outcome in either TOBS patients (odds ratio = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88–1.31) or those with other types (odds ratio = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.94–1.36). However, in patients with other types, if there existed a target mismatch, EVT was independently related to good outcome (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.17–1.81).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The “target mismatch profile” seems to be a possible candidate selection standard of EVT for those with other types of BAO. Future studies should separate TOBS from other types of BAO, and try to use advanced imaging. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:97–106</p>

                <p>Nodding syndrome (NS) is a poorly understood form of childhood-onset epilepsy that is characterized by the pathognomonic ictal phenomenon of repetitive vertical head drops. To evaluate the underlying ictal neurophysiology, ictal EEG features were evaluated in nine participants with confirmed NS from South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda and ictal presence of high frequency gamma oscillations on scalp EEG were assessed. Ictal EEG during the head nodding episode predominantly showed generalized slow waves or sharp-and-slow wave complexes followed by electrodecrement. Augmentation of gamma activity (30–70 Hz) was seen during the head nodding episode in all the participants. We confirm that head nodding episodes in persons with NS from the three geographically distinct regions in sub-Saharan Africa share the common features of slow waves with electrodecrement and superimposed gamma activity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Menopause Status Moderates Sex Differences in Tau Burden: A Framingham PET Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Women have a higher lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men. Among cognitively normal (CN) older adults, women exhibit elevated tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal compared with men. We explored whether menopause exacerbates sex differences in tau deposition in middle-aged adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>328 CN participants from the Framingham Study (mean age = 57 years (±10 years), 161 women, of whom, 104 were post-menopausal) underwent tau and β-amyloid (Aβ)-PET neuroimaging. We examined global Aβ-PET, and tau-PET signal in 5 regions identified <i>a priori</i> as demonstrating significant sex differences in older adults (in temporal, inferior parietal, middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions). We examined sex and menopause status-related differences in each region-of-interest, using linear regressions, as well as interactions with Aβ and APOEε4 genotype.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Women exhibited higher tau-PET signal (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.002), and global Aβ-PET (<i>p</i> = 0.010), than men in inferior parietal, rostral middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions. Compared with age-matched men, post-menopausal women showed significantly higher tau-PET signal in parieto-occipital regions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). By contrast, no differences in tau-PET signal existed between pre-menopausal women and men. Aβ-PET was not associated with menopausal status or age. Neither Aβ-PET nor APOEε4 status moderated sex or menopause associations with tau-PET.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Clear divergence in tauopathy between the sexes are apparent approximately 20 years earlier than previously reported. Menopause status moderated sex differences in Aβ and tau-PET burden, with tau first appearing post-menopause. Sex and menopause differences consistently appeared in middle frontal and parieto-occipital regions but were not moderated by Aβ burden or APOEε4, suggesting that menopause-related tau vulnerability may be independent of AD-related pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A Role for Insulin‐like Growth Factor 1 in the Generation of Epileptic Spasms in a murine model</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Infantile spasms are associated with a wide variety of clinical conditions, including perinatal brain injuries. We have created a model in which prolonged infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) into the neocortex, beginning in infancy, produces a localized lesion and reproduces the behavioral spasms, electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, and drug responsiveness seen clinically. Here, we undertook experiments to explore the possibility that the growth factor IGF-1 plays a role in generating epileptic spasms.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We combined long-term video EEG recordings with quantitative immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses to unravel IGF-1's role in spasm generation. Immunohistochemistry was undertaken in surgically resected tissue from infantile spasms patients. We used viral injections in neonatal conditional IGF-1R knock-out mice to show that an IGF-1-derived tripeptide (1-3)IGF-1, acts through the IGF-1 receptor to abolish spasms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Immunohistochemical methods revealed widespread loss of IGF-1 from cortical neurons, but an increase in IGF-1 in the reactive astrocytes in the TTX-induced lesion. Very similar changes were observed in the neocortex from patients with spasms. In animals, we observed reduced signaling through the IGF-1 growth pathways in areas remote from the lesion. To show the reduction in IGF-1 expression plays a role in spasm generation, epileptic rats were treated with (1-3)IGF-1. We provide 3 lines of evidence that (1-3)IGF-1 activates the IGF-1 signaling pathway by acting through the receptor for IGF-1. Treatment with (1-3)IGF-1 abolished spasms and hypsarrhythmia-like activity in the majority of animals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Results implicate IGF-1 in the pathogenesis of infantile spasms and IGF-1 analogues as potential novel therapies for this neurodevelopmental disorder. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:45–60</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Many transcription factors boost neural development and differentiation in specific directions and serve for identifying similar or homologous structures across species. The expression of Orthopedia (Otp) is critical for the development of certain cell groups along the vertebrate neuraxis, for example, the medial amygdala or hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons. Therefore, the primary focus of the present study is the distribution of Orthopedia a (Otpa) in the larval and adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) brain. Since Otpa is also critical for the development of zebrafish basal diencephalic dopaminergic cells, colocalization of Otpa with the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is studied. Cellular colocalization of Otpa and dopamine is only seen in magnocellular neurons of the periventricular posterior tubercular nucleus and in the posterior tuberal nucleus. Otpa-positive cells occur in many additional structures along the zebrafish neuraxis, from the secondary prosencephalon down to the hindbrain. Furthermore, Otpa expression is studied in <i>shh</i>-GFP and <i>islet1</i>-GFP transgenic zebrafish. Otpa-positive cells only express <i>shh</i> in dopaminergic magnocellular periventricular posterior tubercular cells, and only colocalize with <i>islet1</i>-GFP in the ventral zone and prerecess caudal periventricular hypothalamic zone and the perilemniscal nucleus. The scarcity of cellular colocalization of Otpa in <i>islet1</i>-GFP cells indicates that the Shh<i>-islet1</i> neurogenetic pathway is not active in most Otpa-expressing domains. Our analysis reveals detailed correspondences between mouse and zebrafish forebrain territories including the zebrafish intermediate nucleus of the ventral telencephalon and the mouse medial amygdala. The zebrafish preoptic Otpa-positive domain represents the neuropeptidergic supraopto-paraventricular region of all tetrapods. Otpa domains in the zebrafish basal plate hypothalamus suggest that the ventral periventricular hypothalamic zone corresponds to the <i>otp</i>-expressing basal hypothalamic tuberal field in the mouse. Furthermore, the mouse <i>otp</i> domain in the mammillary hypothalamus compares partly to our Otpa-positive domain in the prerecess caudal periventricular hypothalamic zone (Hc-a).</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Orchestrated neuronal migration and cortical folding: A computational and experimental study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shuolun Wang, Kengo Saito, Hiroshi Kawasaki, Maria A. Holland</p>

Brain development involves precisely orchestrated genetic, biochemical, and mechanical events. At the cellular level, neuronal proliferation in the innermost zone of the brain followed by migration towards the outermost layer results in a rapid increase in brain surface area, outpacing the volumetric growth of the brain, and forming the highly folded cortex. This work aims to provide mechanistic insights into the process of brain development and cortical folding using a biomechanical model that couples cell division and migration with volumetric growth. Unlike phenomenological growth models, our model tracks the spatio-temporal development of cohorts of neurons born at different times, with each cohort modeled separately as an advection-diffusion process and the total cell density determining the extent of volume growth. We numerically implement our model in Abaqus/Standard (2020) by writing user-defined element (UEL) subroutines. For model calibration, we apply <i>in utero</i> electroporation (IUE) to ferret brains to visualize and track cohorts of neurons born at different stages of embryonic development. Our calibrated simulations of cortical folding align qualitatively with the ferret experiments. We have made our experimental data and finite-element implementation available online to offer other researchers a modeling platform for future study of neurological disorders associated with atypical neurodevelopment and cortical malformations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A weighted constraint satisfaction approach to human goal-directed decision making</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuxuan Li, James L. McClelland</p>

When we plan for long-range goals, proximal information cannot be exploited in a blindly myopic way, as relevant future information must also be considered. But when a subgoal must be resolved first, irrelevant future information should not interfere with the processing of more proximal, subgoal-relevant information. We explore the idea that decision making in both situations relies on the flexible modulation of the degree to which different pieces of information under consideration are weighted, rather than explicitly decomposing a problem into smaller parts and solving each part independently. We asked participants to find the shortest goal-reaching paths in mazes and modeled their initial path choices as a noisy, weighted information integration process. In a base task where choosing the optimal initial path required weighting starting-point and goal-proximal factors equally, participants did take both constraints into account, with participants who made more accurate choices tending to exhibit more balanced weighting. The base task was then embedded as an initial subtask in a larger maze, where the same two factors constrained the optimal path to a subgoal, and the final goal position was irrelevant to the initial path choice. In this more complex task, participants’ choices reflected predominant consideration of the subgoal-relevant constraints, but also some influence of the initially-irrelevant final goal. More accurate participants placed much less weight on the optimality-irrelevant goal and again tended to weight the two initially-relevant constraints more equally. These findings suggest that humans may rely on a graded, task-sensitive weighting of multiple constraints to generate approximately optimal decision outcomes in both hierarchical and non-hierarchical goal-directed tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Prediction and expression analysis of deleterious nonsynonymous SNPs of Arabidopsis ACD11 gene by combining computational algorithms and molecular docking approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mahmudul Hasan Rifat, Jamil Ahmed, Milad Ahmed, Foeaz Ahmed, Airin Gulshan, Mahmudul Hasan</p>

Accelerated cell death 11 (ACD11) is an autoimmune gene that suppresses pathogen infection in plants by preventing plant cells from becoming infected by any pathogen. This gene is widely known for growth inhibition, premature leaf chlorosis, and defense-related programmed cell death (PCD) in seedlings before flowering in <i>Arabidopsis</i> plant. Specific amino acid changes in the ACD11 protein’s highly conserved domains are linked to autoimmune symptoms including constitutive defensive responses and necrosis without pathogen awareness. The molecular aspect of the aberrant activity of the ACD11 protein is difficult to ascertain. The purpose of our study was to find the most deleterious mutation position in the ACD11 protein and correlate them with their abnormal expression pattern. Using several computational methods, we discovered PCD vulnerable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACD11. We analysed the RNA-Seq data, identified the detrimental nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNP), built genetically mutated protein structures and used molecular docking to assess the impact of mutation. Our results demonstrated that the A15T and A39D mutations in the GLTP domain were likely to be extremely detrimental mutations that inhibit the expression of the ACD11 protein domain by destabilizing its composition, as well as disrupt its catalytic effectiveness. When compared to the A15T mutant, the A39D mutant was more likely to destabilize the protein structure. In conclusion, these mutants can aid in the better understanding of the vast pool of PCD susceptibilities connected to ACD11 gene GLTP domain activation.

Understanding tropical biology is important for solving complex problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and zoonotic pandemics, but biology curricula view research mostly via a temperate-zone lens. Integrating tropical research into biology education is urgently needed to tackle these issues.

Tropical biology is currently largely absent from undergraduate curricula. The integration of authentic research in tropical biology could promote internationality among scientists and provide experiential learning that enables students to address complex global problems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The connecting cilium inner scaffold provides a structural foundation that protects against retinal degeneration</a></h4>

Inherited retinal degeneration due to loss of photoreceptor cells is a leading cause of human blindness. These cells possess a photosensitive outer segment linked to the cell body through the connecting cilium (CC). While structural defects of the CC have been associated with retinal degeneration, its nanoscale molecular composition, assembly, and function are barely known. Here, using expansion microscopy and electron microscopy, we reveal the molecular architecture of the CC and demonstrate that microtubules are linked together by a CC inner scaffold containing POC5, CENTRIN, and FAM161A. Dissecting CC inner scaffold assembly during photoreceptor development in mouse revealed that it acts as a structural zipper, progressively bridging microtubule doublets and straightening the CC. Furthermore, we show that <i>Fam161a</i> disruption in mouse leads to specific CC inner scaffold loss and triggers microtubule doublet spreading, prior to outer segment collapse and photoreceptor degeneration, suggesting a molecular mechanism for a subtype of retinitis pigmentosa.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Teledentistry: a new oral care delivery tool among Indian dental professionals – a questionnaire study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The sudden massive spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a major public health emergency and changed the scene of the health care globally. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most dental treatment procedures were considered as major sources of infection transmission. Thus, the current survey aimed at evaluating knowledge, awareness and attitude of dental professional of India towards teledentistry. Methods: A pre structured questionnaire was framed and distributed among 600 dental professionals of India using email, WhatsApp and other social media modes.  SPSS version 17 was used for data analysis. The Chi-Square, student t test and one way ANOVA test were applied to assess the association between qualification, type of practice and participant response.  Logistic regression analysis was also carried out. Results: In total, 431 dental professionals completed the survey. Overall, 94.7% of dental professionals were aware about teledentistry and agreed it is useful in fulfilling needs of the community at great amount. A statistically significant difference was found for questions related to the application of teledentistry for all branches, whether it is a good tool to assess oral hygiene in remote areas and its usefulness in training in primary health care centre when comparison was done among dental professionals and specialist in different branches of dentistry. Conclusions: Within the limits of the study, findings show that study participants exhibited good knowledge and awareness regarding teledentistry. The participants exhibited positive attitude towards teledentistry but at the same time expressed the uncertainty in challenges which they may face in teledentistry. Lack of training, advanced infrastructure, good connectivity and network are main issues they were concerned about. The other important point of concern is many participants felt teledentistry cannot be applied for all branches of dentistry. Future research should focus on this aspect of teledentistry.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perception of health care students towards lectures as a teaching and learning method in the COVID era - A multicentric cross-sectional study from India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The sudden precipitation of the pandemic forced undergraduates to take refuge at home, deserting the campus. Consequently, the age-old classroom in person teaching-learning (T-L) method shifted and lessons had to be conducted online. In previous decades, archetypical classroom lectures survived a lot of criticism in the face of the quasi-passive nature of T-L  methodology. There are very few studies that reflect undergraduate students' perceptions of lectures. This study aimed to evaluate undergraduate students’ perceptions of lectures using an online questionnaire with 13 items, which was circulated to undergraduate students of medical, physiotherapy, and nursing courses in three settings at different locations of private and public health schools. There was a total of 877 responses. The surveyed students were in favor of lectures and considered them indispensable for undergraduate learning. They preferred it as a kind of organized learning through the teacher’s own experiences. Our study suggests that it is not the ‘lecture’ that requires mending but possibly teachers require better training, application of effective audio-visual aids, and innovative techniques to sustain students' interest in the class.

                Background: The purpose of this work is to study the prospects of using charity lotteries as a marketing tool for involving consumers and employees in charitable activities. Methods: The research methodology is based on the principles of the theory of planned behavior by Ajzen. Results: The study confirmed that behavioral intention is correlated with actual behavior. Subjective norms factors have the most significant influence on behavioral intention. Conclusions: Correlation analysis allowed us to establish a weak effect of socio-demographic characteristics (Age, Gender, Capital Status, Ownership of Home, Educational Qualification, Employment, Annual Income) on behavior. The experience of participating in the lottery in the past also turned out to be insignificant. There is reason to believe that Russian consumers' decision to participate in the charity lottery is impulsive or due to pressure from their surroundings.

                Background: Pleiotropic actions of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the brain are context- and cell-dependent, but whether this holds for their receptors (insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), respectively), is less clear. Methods: We compared mice lacking IR or IGF-IR in glial fibrillary astrocytic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes in a tamoxifen-regulated manner, to clarify their role in this type of glial cells, as the majority of data of their actions in brain have been obtained in neurons. Results: We observed that mice lacking IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP IR KO mice) develop mood disturbances and maintained intact cognition, while at the same time show greater pathology when cross-bred with APP/PS1 mice, a model of familial Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Conversely, mice lacking IGF-IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP-IGF-IR KO mice) show cognitive disturbances, maintained mood tone, and show control-dependent changes in AD-like pathology. Conclusions: These observations confirm that the role of IR and IGF-IR in the brain is cell-specific and context-dependent.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance measurement of university-industry collaboration in the technology transfer process: A systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background To fostering organizational improvement, the performance must be assessed. In the context of university-industry collaboration (UIC) in the technology transfer process, the performance of also must be assessed. However, the performance covers complex aspects which makes it difficult to be measured. This indicates the need to have a better understanding of the methods used. Therefore, this study presents a systematic literature review on the performance measurement of UIC in the technology transfer process that can give to the researchers an easy and quick overview of the literature about (mainly) the methods used for the performance measurement. Methods We used two major scientific databases, i.e., Scopus and Web of Science. We defined four groups of keywords to restrict the search criteria. We only consider articles published in the last decade, during 2010 to November 2021. The search procedure contains four phases following the PRISMA framework: (i) identification, (ii) screening, (iii) eligibility, and (iv) inclusion. Results The final screening process resulted in 24 articles that satisfied the criteria for inclusion in this review. The collected articles are categorized according to two classifications. The first is about type of the collaboration, while the second is about the methods used. We investigated three types of collaboration, i.e., at the level of technology transfer office (TTO), the academic (university) spin-offs, and joint-research. There are several methods for assessing performance, ranging from qualitative, quantitative, to mixed methods. Conclusion The literature review leads us to the following conclusions. First, most studies are conducted at the TTO level, in which it is anticipated since it is the most common form UIC. Second, the application of data envelopment analysis is still preferable than other method in measuring the performance. This study also provides possible research directions that can facilitate scholars to uncover gaps in the literature.

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Biotechnology ethics for food and agriculture</a></h4>

              
                In January, the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Law (NBFDL) went into effect, requiring all US food manufacturers to disclose whether their products contain bioengineered ingredients (1). However, the law is the subject of debate, with critics arguing that it inhibits rather than increases transparency around the use of biotechnology in food (2). Given the importance of the agbiotech industry, the Biden-Harris administration should develop an agricultural biotechnology advisory commission devoted to inclusive deliberation on ethics and governance in agricultural and food biotechnology.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glycine encephalopathy, also known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), is an inherited neurometabolic disorder with variable clinical course and severity, ranging from infantile epileptic encephalopathy to psychiatric disorders. A precise phenotypic characterization and an evaluation of predictive approaches are needed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Longitudinal clinical and biochemical data of 25 individuals with NKH from the patient registry of the International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders were studied with in silico analyses, pathogenicity scores, and molecular modeling of <i>GLDC</i> and <i>AMT</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Symptom onset (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and diagnosis occur earlier in life in severe NKH (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Presenting symptoms affect the age at diagnosis. Psychiatric problems occur predominantly in attenuated NKH. Onset age ≥ 3 months (66% specificity, 100% sensitivity, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma glycine ratio ≤ 0.09 (57% specificity, 100% sensitivity, AUC = 0.88) are sensitive indicators for attenuated NKH, whereas CSF glycine concentration ≥ 116.5μmol/l (100% specificity, 93% sensitivity, AUC = 0.97) and CSF/plasma glycine ratio ≥ 0.15 (100% specificity, 64% sensitivity, AUC = 0.88) are specific for severe forms. A ratio threshold of 0.128 discriminates the overlapping range. We present 10 new <i>GLDC</i> variants. Two mild variants resulted in attenuated, whereas 2 severe variants or 1 mild and 1 severe variant led to severe phenotype. Based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic parameters, we propose a severity prediction model.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study widens the phenotypic spectrum of attenuated NKH and expands the number of pathogenic variants. The multiparametric approach provides a promising tool to predict disease severity, helping to improve clinical management strategies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Background: Recent study suggests that obesity is associated with a broad executive function decline. Several dietary intervention studies may improve executive function domains. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the effect of dietary modification on executive function domains in adult patients with obesity. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane Library, Science Direct/SCOPUS, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to obtain articles until April 30th, 2022. The main outcome of interest was the change in executive function domains (inhibition, cognitive flexibility, working memory, verbal fluency, decision making, and planning). We extracted data on the standardized mean difference (SMD) between the dietary intervention and control groups in change from baseline executive function domains. The meta-analysis with a random effect model was performed using STATA, and the Risk of Bias (RoB 2.0) tool was used to determine the quality of the included studies. Subsequently, to assess the quality of evidence, we used GRADE tools. Results: A total of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met the objectives were obtained. This meta-analysis showed that dietary modification improved cognitive flexibility [SMD=0.303 (-0.527 to -0.079), P=0.008, I2= 0%], working memory [SMD=0.601 (0.076 to 1.125), P=0.025, I2=83.6%], and verbal fluency [(SMD=0.223 (0.002 to 0.428), P=0.033, I2=16.3%]. However, most RCTs (six out of 10) had some concerns due to allocation concealment, unclear blinding assessment or participants, and a high dropout rate. Thus, further well-controlled RCTs are needed to confirm these results. Conclusions: Dietary modification might improve executive function domains in adult individuals with overweight/obesity. Registration: This systematic review is registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022332572; registered 24 May 2022).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The current study provides a detailed architectural analysis of the subpallial telencephalon of the tree pangolin. In the tree pangolin, the subpallial telencephalon was divided into septal and striatopallidal regions. The septal region contained the septal nuclear complex, diagonal band of Broca, and the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis. The striatopallidal region comprised of the dorsal (caudate, putamen, internal and external globus pallidus) and ventral (nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, ventral pallidum, nucleus basalis, basal part of the substantia innominata, lateral stripe of the striatum, navicular nucleus, and the major island of Calleja) striatopallidal complexes. In the tree pangolin, the organization and numbers of nuclei forming these regions and complexes, their topographical relationships to each other, and the cyto-, myelo-, and chemoarchitecture, were found to be very similar to that observed in commonly studied mammals. Minor variations, such as less nuclear parcellation in the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis, may represent species-specific variations, or may be the result of the limited range of stains used. Given the overall similarity across mammalian species, it appears that the subpallial telencephalon of the mammalian brain is highly conserved in terms of evolutionary changes detectable with the methods used. It is also likely that the functions associated with these nuclei in other mammals can be translated directly to the tree pangolin, albeit with the understanding that the stimuli that produce activity within these regions may be specific to the life history requirements of the tree pangolin.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">BET-ting on histone proteomics in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                In a recent study, Farrelly, Zheng, and colleagues used a histone proteomics approach and patient-derived neurons to show increase in histone variant H2A.Z acetylation associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). They identified the bromo- and extraterminal (BET) protein BRD4 as an H2A.Z acetylation ‘reader’, and showed that a BRD4 inhibitor ameliorated the SCZ-associated transcriptional signature, revealing a new candidate target for treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selfee, self-supervised features extraction of animal behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Fast and accurately characterizing animal behaviors is crucial for neuroscience research. Deep learning models are efficiently used in laboratories for behavior analysis. However, it has not been achieved to use an end-to-end unsupervised neural network to extract comprehensive and discriminative features directly from social behavior video frames for annotation and analysis purposes. Here, we report a self-supervised feature extraction (Selfee) convolutional neural network with multiple downstream applications to process video frames of animal behavior in an end-to-end way. Visualization and classification of the extracted features (Meta-representations) validate that Selfee processes animal behaviors in a way similar to human perception. We demonstrate that Meta-representations can be efficiently used to detect anomalous behaviors that are indiscernible to human observation and hint in-depth analysis. Furthermore, time-series analyses of Meta-representations reveal the temporal dynamics of animal behaviors. In conclusion, we present a self-supervised learning approach to extract comprehensive and discriminative features directly from raw video recordings of animal behaviors and demonstrate its potential usage for various downstream applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamics of allosteric regulation of the phospholipase C-γ isozymes upon recruitment to membranes</a></h4>

              
                Numerous receptor tyrosine kinases and immune receptors activate phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) isozymes at membranes to control diverse cellular processes including phagocytosis, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The molecular details of this process are not well understood. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we show that PLC-γ1 is relatively inert to lipid vesicles that contain its substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), unless first bound to the kinase domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1). Exchange occurs throughout PLC-γ1 and is exaggerated in PLC-γ1 containing an oncogenic substitution (D1165H) that allosterically activates the lipase. These data support a model whereby initial complex formation shifts the conformational equilibrium of PLC-γ1 to favor activation. This receptor-induced priming of PLC-γ1 also explains the capacity of a kinase-inactive fragment of FGFR1 to modestly enhance the lipase activity of PLC-γ1 operating on lipid vesicles but not a soluble analog of PIP<sub>2</sub> and highlights potential cooperativity between receptor engagement and membrane proximity. Priming is expected to be greatly enhanced for receptors embedded in membranes and nearly universal for the myriad of receptors and co-receptors that bind the PLC-γ isozymes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of Synaptotagmin-SNARE-complexin complexes bridging a vesicle and a flat lipid bilayer</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic vesicles are primed into a state that is ready for fast neurotransmitter release upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to Synaptotagmin-1. This state likely includes trans-SNARE complexes between the vesicle and plasma membranes that are bound to Synaptotagmin-1 and complexins. However, the nature of this state and the steps leading to membrane fusion are unclear, in part because of the difficulty of studying this dynamic process experimentally. To shed light into these questions, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of systems containing trans-SNARE complexes between two flat bilayers or a vesicle and a flat bilayer with or without fragments of Synaptotagmin-1 and/or complexin-1. Our results need to be interpreted with caution because of the limited simulation times and the absence of key components, but suggest mechanistic features that may control release and help visualize potential states of the primed Synaptotagmin-1-SNARE-complexin-1 complex. The simulations suggest that SNAREs alone induce formation of extended membrane-membrane contact interfaces that may fuse slowly, and that the primed state contains macromolecular assemblies of trans-SNARE complexes bound to the Synaptotagmin-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain and complexin-1 in a spring-loaded configuration that prevents premature membrane merger and formation of extended interfaces, but keeps the system ready for fast fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Self-organization of in vitro neuronal assemblies drives to complex network topology</a></h4>

              
                Activity-dependent self-organization plays an important role in the formation of specific and stereotyped connectivity patterns in neural circuits. By combining neuronal cultures, and tools with approaches from network neuroscience and information theory, we can study how complex network topology emerges from local neuronal interactions. We constructed effective connectivity networks using a transfer entropy analysis of spike trains recorded from rat embryo dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures between 6 and 35 days in vitro to investigate how the topology evolves during maturation. The methodology for constructing the networks considered the synapse delay and addressed the influence of firing rate and population bursts as well as spurious effects on the inference of connections. We found that the number of links in the networks grew over the course of development, shifting from a segregated to a more integrated architecture. As part of this progression, three significant aspects of complex network topology emerged. In agreement with previous in silico and in vitro studies, a small-world architecture was detected, largely due to strong clustering among neurons. Additionally, the networks developed in a modular topology, with most modules comprising nearby neurons. Finally, highly active neurons acquired topological characteristics that made them important nodes to the network and integrators of modules. These findings leverage new insights into how neuronal effective network topology relates to neuronal assembly self-organization mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct representation of cue-outcome association by D1 and D2 neurons in the ventral striatum’s olfactory tubercle</a></h4>

              
                Positive and negative associations acquired through olfactory experience are thought to be especially strong and long-lasting. The conserved direct olfactory sensory input to the ventral striatal olfactory tubercle (OT) and its convergence with dense dopaminergic input to the OT could underlie this privileged form of associative memory, but how this process occurs is not well understood. We imaged the activity of the two canonical types of striatal neurons, expressing D1- or D2-type dopamine receptors, in the OT at cellular resolution while mice learned odor-outcome associations ranging from aversive to rewarding. D1 and D2 neurons both responded to rewarding and aversive odors. D1 neurons in the OT robustly and bidirectionally represented odor valence, responding similarly to odors predicting similar outcomes regardless of odor identity. This valence representation persisted even in the absence of a licking response to the odors and in the absence of the outcomes, indicating a true transformation of odor sensory information by D1 OT neurons. In contrast, D2 neuronal representation of the odor-outcome associations was weaker, contingent on a licking response by the mouse, and D2 neurons were more selective for odor identity than valence. Stimulus valence coding in the OT was modality-sensitive, with separate sets of D1 neurons responding to odors and sounds predicting the same outcomes, suggesting that integration of multimodal valence information happens downstream of the OT. Our results point to distinct representation of identity and valence of odor stimuli by D1 and D2 neurons in the OT.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiple timescales of sensory-evidence accumulation across the dorsal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical areas seem to form a hierarchy of intrinsic timescales, but the relevance of this organization for cognitive behavior remains unknown. In particular, decisions requiring the gradual accrual of sensory evidence over time recruit widespread areas across this hierarchy. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this recruitment is related to the intrinsic integration timescales of these widespread areas. We trained mice to accumulate evidence over seconds while navigating in virtual reality and optogenetically silenced the activity of many cortical areas during different brief trial epochs. We found that the inactivation of all tested areas affected the evidence-accumulation computation. Specifically, we observed distinct changes in the weighting of sensory evidence occurring during and before silencing, such that frontal inactivations led to stronger deficits on long timescales than posterior cortical ones. Inactivation of a subset of frontal areas also led to moderate effects on behavioral processes beyond evidence accumulation. Moreover, large-scale cortical Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity during task performance displayed different temporal integration windows. Our findings suggest that the intrinsic timescale hierarchy of distributed cortical areas is an important component of evidence-accumulation mechanisms.

                Animals can evolve dramatic sensory functions in response to environmental constraints, but little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these changes. The Mexican tetra, <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i>, is a leading model to study genetic, behavioral, and physiological evolution by comparing eyed surface populations and blind cave populations. We compared neurophysiological responses of posterior lateral line afferent neurons and motor neurons across <i>A. mexicanus</i> populations to reveal how shifts in sensory function may shape behavioral diversity. These studies indicate differences in intrinsic afferent signaling and gain control across populations. Elevated endogenous afferent activity identified a lower response threshold in the lateral line of blind cavefish relative to surface fish leading to increased evoked potentials during hair cell deflection in cavefish.. We next measured the effect of inhibitory corollary discharges from hindbrain efferent neurons onto afferents during locomotion. We discovered that three independently-derived cavefish populations have evolved persistent afferent activity during locomotion, suggesting for the first time that partial loss of function in the efferent system can be an evolutionary mechanism for neural adaptation of a vertebrate sensory system.

                CRISPR technology has made generation of gene knock-outs widely achievable in cells. However, once inactivated, their re-activation remains difficult, especially in diploid cells. Here, we present DExCon (<span class="underline">D</span>oxycycline-mediated endogenous gene <span class="underline">Ex</span>pression <span class="underline">Con</span>trol), DExogron (DExCon combined with auxin-mediated targeted protein degradation), and LUXon (light responsive DExCon) approaches which combine one-step CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeted knockin of fluorescent proteins with an advanced Tet-inducible TRE3GS promoter. These approaches combine blockade of active gene expression with the ability to re-activate expression on demand, including activation of silenced genes. Systematic control can be exerted using doxycycline or spatiotemporally by light, and we demonstrate functional knock-out/rescue in the closely related Rab11 family of vesicle trafficking regulators. Fluorescent protein knock-in results in bright signals compatible with low-light live microscopy from monoallelic modification, the potential to simultaneously image different alleles of the same gene, and bypasses the need to work with clones. Protein levels are easily tunable to correspond with endogenous expression through cell sorting (DExCon), timing of light illumination (LUXon), or by exposing cells to different levels of auxin (DExogron). Furthermore, our approach allowed us to quantify previously unforeseen differences in vesicle dynamics, transferrin receptor recycling, expression kinetics, and protein stability among highly similar endogenous Rab11 family members and their colocalization in triple knock-in ovarian cancer cell lines.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The relationship between response dynamics and the formation of confidence varies across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Accurate metacognitive judgements, such as forming a confidence judgement, are crucial for goal-directed behaviour but decline with older age. Besides changes in the sensory processing of stimulus features, there might also be changes in the motoric aspects of giving responses that account for age-related changes in confidence. In order to assess the association between confidence and response parameters across the adult lifespan, we measured response times and peak forces in a four-choice flanker task with subsequent confidence judgements. In 65 healthy adults from 20 to 76 years of age, we showed divergent associations of each measure with confidence, depending on decision accuracy. Participants indicated higher confidence after faster responses in correct but not incorrect trials. They also indicated higher confidence after less forceful responses in errors but not in correct trials. Notably, these associations were age-dependent as the relationship between confidence and response time was more pronounced in older participants, while the relationship between confidence and response force decayed with age. Our results add to the notion that confidence is related to response parameters and demonstrate noteworthy changes in the observed associations across the adult lifespan. These changes potentially constitute an expression of general age-related deficits in performance monitoring or, alternatively, index a failing mechanism in the computation of confidence in older adults.

                Background: Thermal and tactile stimuli are transduced by different receptor classes. However, mechano- and thermo-sensitive afferents interact at spinal and supraspinal levels. Yet, most cold stimulation studies are confounded by mechanical contact, making these interactions difficult to isolate. Methods for precise control of purely thermal stimulations remain challenging, particularly in the cold range. New Method: We developed a flexible, multi-purpose, non-tactile, focal, temperature-controlled cold stimulator. This method controls the exposure of a target skin region to a dry-ice source. Using a thermal camera to monitor skin temperature, and adjusting the source-skin distance accordingly, we could deliver non-tactile cold stimuli with customisable profiles, for studying different aspects of thermal sensation. Results: To validate our method, we measured absolute and relative thresholds for cold sensation without mechanical contact in 13 human volunteer participants, using the method of limits. We found that the absolute cold detection threshold was 32.71oC +- 0.88 oC. This corresponded to a threshold relative to each participants baseline skin temperature of -1.08 oC +- 0.37 oC. Comparisons with Existing Method: Our method allows controllable cold stimulation without the confound of mechanical contact, in a controllable and focal manner, for the first time. Conclusions: We report a non-contact cold thermal stimulator and accompanying control system. We used this to measure a pure cold threshold, in the absence of confounding touch. Our method enables more targeted studies of both cold sensory pathways, and of cold-touch interactions.

                The brain evolved to govern behavior in a dynamic world, in which pertinent information about choices is often in flux. Thus, the commitment to an action choice must reflect a balance between monitoring that information and the necessity to act before opportunities are lost. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of dynamic decision-making in humans using low dimensional space representation of brain wide magnetoencephalography recordings. We show that the principal components (PCs) of alpha (9-13 Hz) and beta power (16-24 Hz) are involved in tracking sensory information evolving over time in the sensorimotor and visual cortex. We also found that alpha PCs reflect the commitment to a particular choice, while beta PCs reflect motor execution. Finally, higher frequency components in subcortical areas reflect the adjustment of speed-accuracy tradeoff policies. These results provide a new detailed characterization of the distributed oscillatory brain processes underlying dynamic decision-making in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural responses to instructed positive couple interaction: An fMRI study on compliment sharing</a></h4>

              
                Love is probably the most fascinating feeling that a person ever experiences. However, little is known about what is happening in the brains of a romantic couple - the central and most salient relationship during adult age - while they are particularly tender and exchanging loving words with one another. To gain insight into nearly natural couple interaction, we collected data from N = 84 individuals (after including N = 43 heterosexual romantic couples) simultaneously in two functional magnetic resonance imaging scanners, while they sent and received compliments, i.e. short messages about what they liked about each other and their relationship. Activation patterns during compliment sharing in the individuals revealed a broad pattern of activated brain areas known to be involved in empathy and reward processing. Notably, the ventral striatum, including parts of the putamen, was activated particularly when selecting messages for the partner. This indicates that the anticipation of a beloved person's positive reaction is rewarding already. Therefore, we provide initial evidence that the neural systems underlying giving a verbal treat to a romantic partner seem to involve dopaminergic basal ganglia. These results can have important implications for the neurobiological mechanisms protecting and stabilizing romantic relationships, which build a highly relevant aspect of human life and health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gray matter cortical thickness predicts individual pain sensitivity: a multi-center machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                Pain sensitivity is known to considerably vary across individuals. While the variability in pain has been linked to structural neural correlates, it is still unclear how well these findings replicate in independent data and whether they are powerful enough to provide reliable pain sensitivity predictions on the individual level. In this study, we constructed a predictive model of pain sensitivity utilising structural MRI-based cortical thickness data from a multi-center dataset (3 centers, 131 healthy participants). Cross-validated estimates revealed a statistically significant and clinically relevant predictive performance (Pearson-r = 0.36, p < 0.0005). The predictions were found to be specific to pain sensitivity and not biased towards potential confounding effects (e.g., anxiety, stress, depression, center-effects). Analysis of model coefficients suggests that the most robust cortical thickness predictors of pain sensitivity are the right rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus and left temporal pole. Cortical thickness in these regions was negatively correlated to pain sensitivity. Our results can be considered as a proof-of-concept for the capacity of brain morphology to predict pain sensitivity, paving the way towards future multimodal brain-based biomarkers of pain. Key words: predictive modelling, machine learning, gray matter, cortical thickness, pain sensitivity, rACC, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal pole, QST, pain thresholds, LASSO

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Towards A More Informative Representation of the Fetal-Neonatal Brain Connectome using Variational Autoencoder</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have helped elucidate previously inaccessible trajectories of early-life prenatal and neonatal brain development. To date, the interpretation of fetal-neonatal fMRI data has relied on linear analytic models, akin to adult neuroimaging data. However, unlike the adult brain, the fetal and newborn brain develops extraordinarily rapidly, far outpacing any other brain development period across the lifespan. Consequently, conventional linear computational models may not adequately capture these accelerated and complex neurodevelopmental trajectories during this critical period of brain development along the prenatal-neonatal continuum. To obtain a nuanced understanding of fetal-neonatal brain development, including non-linear growth, for the first time, we developed quantitative, systems-wide representations of neuronal circuitry in a large sample (>700) of fetuses, preterm, and full-term neonates using an unsupervised deep generative model called Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a model previously shown to be superior to linear models in representing complex resting state data in healthy adults. Here, we demonstrated that non-linear brain features, i.e., latent variables, derived with the VAE, carried important individual neural signatures, leading to improved representation of prenatal-neonatal brain maturational patterns and more accurate and stable age prediction compared to linear models. Using the VAE decoder, we also revealed distinct functional brain networks spanning the sensory and default mode networks. Using the VAE, we are able to reliably capture and quantify complex, non-linear fetal-neonatal functional neural connectivity. This will lay the critical foundation for detailed mapping of healthy and aberrant functional brain signatures that have their origins in fetal life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG Network Classification of Alzheimer's disease: Comparison of Functional Connectivity Methods</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia in the world. AD disrupts neuronal pathways and thus is commonly viewed as a network disorder. Many studies demonstrate the power of functional connectivity (FC) graph-based biomarkers for automated diagnosis of AD using electroencephalography (EEG). However, various FC measures are commonly utilised as each aims to quantify an unique aspect of brain coupling. Graph neural networks (GNN) provide a powerful framework for learning on graphs. While there is a growing number of studies using GNN to classify EEG brain graphs, it is unclear which method should be utilised to estimate the brain graph. We use eight FC measures to estimate FC brain graphs from sensor-level EEG signals. GNN models are trained in order to compare the performance of the selected FC measures. Additionally, three baseline models based on literature are trained for comparison. We show that GNN models perform significantly better than the other baseline models. Moreover, using FC measures to estimate brain graphs improves the performance of GNN compared to models trained using a fixed graph based on the spatial distance between the EEG sensors. However, no FC measure performs consistently better than the other measures. The best GNN reaches 0.984 area under sensitivity-specificity curve (AUC) and 92% accuracy whereas the best baseline model, a convolutional neural network, has 0.924 AUC and 84.7% accuracy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparison between an exact and a heuristic neural mass model with second order synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neural mass models (NMMs) are designed to reproduce the collective dynamics of neuronal populations. A common framework for NMMs assumes heuristically that the output firing rate of a neural population can be described by a static nonlinear transfer function (NMM1). However, a recent exact mean-field theory for quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons challenges this view by showing that the mean firing rate is not a static function of the neuronal state but follows two coupled nonlinear differential equations (NMM2). Here we analyze and compare these two descriptions in the presence of second-order synaptic dynamics. First, we derive the mathematical equivalence between the two models in the infinitely slow synapse limit, i.e., we show that NMM1 is an approximation of NMM2 in this regime. Next, we evaluate the applicability of this limit in the context of realistic physiological parameter values by analyzing the dynamics of models with inhibitory or excitatory synapses. We show that NMM1 fails to reproduce important dynamical features of the exact model, such as the self-sustained oscillations of an inhibitory interneuron QIF network. Furthermore, in the exact model but not in the limit one, stimulation of a pyramidal cell population induces resonant oscillatory activity whose peak frequency and amplitude increase with the self-coupling gain and the external excitatory input. This may play a role in the enhanced response of densely connected networks to weak uniform inputs, such as the electric fields produced by non-invasive brain stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subventricular zone cytogenesis provides trophic support for neural repair</a></h4>

              
                Stroke enhances proliferation of neural precursor cells within the subventricular zone (SVZ) and induces ectopic migration of newborn cells towards the site of injury. Here we characterize the identity of cells arising from the SVZ after stroke and provide insight into their function by uncovering a mechanism through which they facilitate neural repair and functional recovery. Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that SVZ-derived cells that migrate towards stroke induced cortical lesions in mice are predominantly undifferentiated precursors, suggesting that the main function of post-injury cytogenesis is not cell replacement. We find that SVZ-derived cells are a unique cellular source of trophic factors that instruct neural repair. Chemogenetic ablation of neural precursor cells or conditional knockout of VEGF in the adult neural stem cell lineage impairs neuronal and vascular reparative responses and worsens functional recovery after stroke. In addition, normal aging markedly diminishes the cytogenic response to stroke, resulting in worse functional recovery. Therapeutic replacement of VEGF in peri-infarct cortex is sufficient to induce neural repair and functional recovery in mice with arrested cytogenesis. These findings indicate that the SVZ cytogenic response following brain injury is a source of trophic support that drives neural repair and recovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Label-free, fast, 2-photon volume imaging of the structural organization of peripheral neurons and glia in the enteric ganglia</a></h4>

              
                The enteric nervous system (ENS), sometimes considered as a "second brain" due to its large autonomy from central circuits, is made up of interconnected plexuses organized in a mesh-like network lining the gastrointestinal tract. Originally described as a leading actor of the regulation of digestion, bowel advance and intestinal secretion, its implication in various neuropathologies has recently been demonstrated. However, with only a few exceptions, its morphology and pathologic alterations have been studied on thin sections of the intestinal wall or in dissected explants. Due to its intricate morphology, precious information on its three-dimensional (3-D) architecture and connectivity is often lost. In this context, we have developed a fast, label-free 3-D imaging method of the ENS, based on intrinsic signals of the tissue. We used a custom, fast tissue-clearing protocol based on a high refractive-index aqueous solution, and then characterized the autofluorescence signals arising from the various cellular and sub-cellular components of the ENS. Validation by immunofluorescence and spectral recordings complete our label-free characterization. Finally, we demonstrate the fast acquisition of detailed 3-D image stacks from unlabeled mouse intestine, across the whole intestinal wall and including both the myenteric and submucosal enteric nervous plexuses using a new spinning-disk two-photon microscope. The combination of fast clearing (less than 15 min for 73 % transparency), autofluorescence detection and rapid volumetric imaging (less than a minute for the acquisition of s z-stack of 100 planes (150*150 microns) at 300-nm spatial resolution) paves the way for new applications in fundamental and clinical research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Benefits of individualized brain anatomies and EEG electrode positions for auditory cortex localization</a></h4>

              
                Due to its high temporal resolution and non-invasive nature, electroencephalography (EEG) is considered a method of great value for the field of auditory cognitive neuroscience. In performing source space analyses, localization accuracy poses a bottleneck, which precise forward models based on individualized attributes such as subject anatomy or electrode locations aim to overcome. Yet acquiring anatomical images or localizing EEG electrodes requires significant additional funds and processing time, making it an oftentimes inaccessible asset. Neuroscientific software offers template solutions, on which analyses can be based. For localizing the source of auditory evoked responses, we here compared the results of employing such template anatomies and electrode positions versus the subject-specific ones, as well as combinations of the two. All considered cases represented approaches commonly used in electrophysiological studies. We considered differences between two commonly used inverse solutions (dSPM, sLORETA) and targeted the primary auditory cortex; a notoriously small cortical region that is located within the lateral sulcus, thus more prone to errors in localization. Through systematical comparison of the outcomes in terms of auditory activity attributes and leakage quantification, we assessed how the individualization steps impacted the analyses outcomes. Both electrode locations as well as subject anatomies were found to have an effect, which though varied based on the configuration considered. When comparing the inverse solutions, we moreover found that dSPM more consistently benefited from individualization of subject characteristics. Based on the scientific question considered, our results may be used to facilitate the planning of auditory neuroscientific experiments in terms of expected infrastructure, personnel and funds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter microstructure in face and body networks predicts facial expression and body posture perception across development</a></h4>

              
                Facial expression and body posture recognition have protracted developmental trajectories. Interactions between face and body perception, such as the influence of body posture on facial expression perception, also change with development. While the brain regions underpinning face and body processing are well-defined, little is known about how white-matter tracts linking these regions relate to perceptual development. Here, we obtained complementary diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures (fractional anisotropy FA, spherical mean S), and a quantitative MRI myelin-proxy measure (R1), within white-matter tracts of face- and body-selective networks in children and adolescents and related these to perceptual development. In tracts linking occipital and fusiform face areas, facial expression perception was predicted by age-related microstructural development, as measured by S and R1, as well as age-independent individual differences in microstructure, as measured by FA. Tract microstructure linking the body region in posterior superior temporal sulcus with anterior temporal lobe (ATL) was related to the influence of body on facial expression perception, supporting ATL as a site of face and body network convergence. Overall, our results highlight age-dependent and age-independent constraints that white-matter microstructure poses on perceptual abilities during development and the importance of complementary microstructural measures in linking brain structure and behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Caecal dysfunction in the NL3R451C mouse model of autism</a></h4>

              
                The mouse caecum is a pouch-like structure that is anatomically similar to the human appendix and is hypothesised to serve as a reservoir for commensal bacteria. The gastrointestinal tract is also home to the largest immunological organ of the body and the enteric nervous system (ENS), which regulates gut motility and secretion. The caecum is therefore an ideal location to study neuro-immune-microbe interactions in gut-brain communication. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; autism) frequently present with gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to core diagnostic behavioural features, implying a gut-brain link. More broadly, changes in gut-brain connectivity are now thought to play a critical role in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we employed a mouse model of autism expressing a missense mutation in the neuroligin-3 post-synaptic protein (NL3R451C) that affects brain and enteric neuronal activity. We previously observed abnormal caecal ENS architecture and immune cell morphology in the caecal patch in this model, however it is unknown if caecal function is altered in NL3R451C mice. Using a tri-cannulation approach to record motility patterns in the mouse caecum, we identified caecal motor complexes in ex vivo preparations. Caecal permeability and neurally-evoked secretion levels were also studied. Key immune populations including gut macrophages and dendritic cells within the caecal patch were also stained using immunofluorescence to investigate shifts in immune activity. Caecal motility patterns in NL3R451C mice differed from wildtype littermates. Specifically, caecal motor complexes occurred at a higher frequency and for a shorter duration in NL3R451C mice than in wildtype littermates. In NL3R451C mice, neurally-evoked caecal secretion was reduced in response to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist (DMPP), but permeability was unchanged. Increased numbers of caecal patches were observed in NL3R451C mice compared to wildtype, but the morphology of examined immune populations were unchanged. Future research is warranted to better understand caecal function and how neuro-immune interactions in the caecum affect health and neurodevelopmental disorders via the gut-brain axis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A model for generating differences in microtubules between axonal branches depending on the distance from terminals</a></h4>

              
                In the remodeling of axonal arbor, the growth and retraction of branches are differentially regulated within a single axon. Although cell-autonomously generated differences in microtubule (MT) turnover are thought to be involved in selective branch regulation, the cellular system whereby neurons generate differences of MTs between axonal branches has not been clarified. Because MT turnover tends to be slower in longer branches compared with neighboring shorter branches, feedback regulation depending on branch length is thought to be involved. In the present study, we generated a model of MT lifetime in axonal terminal branches by adapting a length-dependent model in which parameters for MT dynamics were constant in the arbor. The model predicted that differences in MT lifetime between neighboring branches could be generated depending on the distance from terminals. In addition, the following points were predicted. Firstly, destabilization of MTs throughout the arbor decreased the differences in MT lifetime between branches. Secondly, differences of MT lifetime existed even before MTs entered the branch point. In axonal MTs in primary neurons, treatment with a low concentration of nocodazole significantly decreased the differences of detyrosination (deTyr) and tyrosination (Tyr) of tubulins, indicators of MT turnover. Expansion microscopy of the axonal shaft before the branch point revealed differences in deTyr/Tyr modification on MTs. Our model recapitulates the differences in MT turnover between branches and provides a feedback mechanism for MT regulation that depends on the axonal arbor geometry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epac2 in midbrain dopamine neurons contributes to cocaine reinforcement via facilitation of dopamine release</a></h4>

              
                Chronic exposure to drugs of abuse results in an upregulation of cAMP signaling in the mesolimbic dopamine system, a molecular adaptation thought to be critically involved in the development of drug dependence. Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac2) is a major cAMP effector abundantly expressed in the brain. However, it remains unknown whether Epac2 contributes to cocaine reinforcement. Here, we report that Epac2 in the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes cocaine reinforcement via facilitation of dopamine release. Conditional knockout of Epac2 from midbrain dopamine neurons (Epac2-cKO) and the selective Epac2 inhibitor ESI-05 decreased cocaine self-administration in mice under both fixed-ratio and progressive-ratio reinforcement schedules and across a broad range of cocaine doses. In addition, Epac2 in midbrain dopamine neurons robustly facilitated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in vitro and in vivo. This mechanism is central to the behavioral effects of Epac2 disruption, as chemogenetic activation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons increased dopamine release and reversed the impairment of cocaine self-administration in Epac2-cKO mice. Conversely, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons reduced dopamine release and cocaine self-administration in wild-type mice. Epac2-mediated facilitation of dopamine release may therefore represent a novel and powerful mechanism that contributes to cocaine reinforcement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anticipatory influences on simple sensory-motor behaviors are encoded by rapidly fluctuating neural dynamics across the human brain</a></h4>

              
                A major challenge in understanding how expectations guide sensory-motor behavior has been to relate relatively simple algorithmic explanations to their potentially complex neural substrates. We studied this relationship using intracranial recordings from 23 patients with medically refractory epilepsy performing a simple visual-detection task with variable foreperiod delay. We identified two distinct anticipatory influences on behavior by fitting an abstract motor-preparatory model ("rise-to-bound") to response times (RTs). The first "predictive" process increased reaction speed and premature responses prior to stimulus arrival ("false alarms"), whereas the second "reactive" process increased reaction speed without affecting false alarms. We linked these anticipatory processes to rapidly fluctuating neural-activity patterns across the brain by leveraging the high spatio-temporal resolution and broad coverage of intracranial recordings. Predictive and reactive signals were highly distributed and interspersed throughout the brain but distinguished by their timing (e.g., occurring around response and stimulus onset, respectively), anatomical distribution (e.g., greater representations in MTL and perirolandic areas, respectively), and modulation patterns (e.g., decreased and increased activity during periods of higher expectation, respectively). These results provide new insights into the complex, but identifiable, mappings between specific, behaviorally derived forms of anticipatory information processing and the widespread neural dynamics that implement them.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing the diversity of L2/3 human neocortical neurons in epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                In the current study, we performed whole-cell current clamp recordings from human cortical neurons in layer 2/3 of the human neocortex in order to characterize the diversity of L2/3 human neocortical neurons in epileptic foci with various etiologies in order to begin to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of hyperexcitability which are still mostly unknown. We differentiated neuronal subtypes based on their firing patterns and AHP kinetics or epilepsy subtype (malformation of cortical development (MCD) vs. other (non-MCD)). We found that L2/3 pyramidal neurons have diverse firing properties and action potential kinetics, with some neurons looking remarkably similar to LTS interneurons. We also saw that L2/3 pyramidal neurons could be split into those with fast AHPs and those without, medium AHPs (mAHPs). Based on these parameters, we were unable to significantly differentiate neurons based on firing properties indicating that AHP component kinetics alone do not dictate L2/3 pyramidal neuron firing in human epileptic cortical slices. We also report significant differences in intrinsic properties between MCD and non-MCD and control L2/3 pyramidal neurons and are the first to characterize that wash on of the proconvulsant drug, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), leads to increased AP duration, less firing rate (FR) accommodation, and slowed down AHPs. Overall, the present study is the first to characterize the large variability of L2/3 human neocortical pyramidal neurons, to compare between L2/3 pyramidal neurons within the epileptic foci between MCD and non-MCD cases, to use control tissue from tumor patients without incidence of seizure, and to determine the influence of 4-AP on L2/3 pyramidal neuron intrinsic properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Do training with blurred images make convolutional neural networks closer to humans concerning object recognition performance and internal representations?</a></h4>

              
                It is suggested that experiences of perceiving blurry images in addition to sharp images contribute to the development of robust human visual processing. To computationally investigate the effect of exposure to blurry images, we trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on ImageNet object recognition with a variety of combinations of sharp and blurry images. In agreement with related studies, mixed training on sharp and blurred images (B+S) makes the CNNs close to humans with respect to robust object recognition against a change in image blur. B+S training also reduces the texture bias of CNN in recognition of shape-texture-cue-conflict images, but the effect is not strong enough to achieve a strong shape bias comparable to what humans show. Other tests also suggest that B+S training is not sufficient to produce robust human-like object recognition based on global configurational features. We also show using representational similarity analysis and zero-shot transfer learning that B+S-Net does not acquire blur-robust object recognition through separate specialized sub-networks, each for sharp and blurry images, but through a single network analyzing common image features. However, blur training alone does not automatically create a mechanism like the human brain where subband information is integrated into a common representation. Our analyses suggest that experience with blurred images helps the human brain develop neural networks that robustly recognize the surrounding world, but it is not powerful enough to fill a large gap between humans and CNNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Laminar Distribution of stimulus- and task-related variables related to auditory streaming in core and belt auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Humans and non-human animals parse the auditory scene into distinct auditory objects or "streams" by grouping together stimuli with common features and segregating those with different features. This process is commonly called "auditory scene analysis". Although previous studies have identified neural mechanisms in the primary (core) auditory cortex that may underlie auditory-stream segregation, we do not have a good understanding of the contribution of cortical regions outside of the core auditory cortex to stream segregation nor do we understand the laminar specificity of these contributions. To examine these issues, we recorded translaminar multiunit activity (MUA) from the core and belt auditory cortex in macaque monkeys while they participated in an auditory streaming task designed to provide an objective measure of auditory-stream segregation. We found that MUA encoded both the stimulus variables and the monkey's behavioral choices related to our streaming task. Overall, core MUA was modulated more by the stimulus variables and the monkey's choices than belt MUA. However, whereas neural correlates of these variables were uniformly distributed in the core auditory cortex, stimulus- and choice-related information was predominantly represented in the superficial and deep layers of belt, respectively. These findings support a differential representation of stimulus- and choice-related variables related to auditory scene analysis along the primate auditory cortical pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeled grid cells aligned by a flexible attractor</a></h4>

              
                Entorhinal grid cells implement a spatial code with hexagonal periodicity, signaling the position of the animal within an environment. Grid maps of cells belonging to the same module share spacing and orientation, only differing in relative two-dimensional spatial phase, which could result from their participation in a two-dimensional attractor. Such an architecture, however, has the drawbacks of being complex to construct and rigid, allowing no degrees of freedom for grid cells to deviate from the hexagonal pattern, as happens under a variety of experimental manipulations. Here we show that a simpler one-dimensional architecture is enough to align grid cells equally well. Using topological data analysis, we show that the resulting population activity is a sample of a torus, while the ensemble of maps preserves features of the network architecture. The flexibility of this low dimensional attractor allows it to negotiate with the feedforward inputs the geometry of the representation manifold, rather than imposing it, finding a number of equally viable configurations. Our results represent a proof of principle against the intuition that the architecture and the representation manifold of an attractor are the same topological object, with implications to the study of attractor networks across the brain.

                The relation between the processing of space and time in the brain has been an enduring cross-disciplinary question. Grid cells have been recognized as a hallmark of the mammalian navigation system, with recent studies attesting to their involvement in organization of conceptual knowledge in humans. To determine whether grid-cell-like representations support temporal processing, we asked subjects to mentally simulate changes in age and time-of-day, each constituting a trajectory in an age-day space, while undergoing fMRI. We found that grid-cell-like representations supported trajecting across this age-day space. Furthermore, brain regions concurrently coding past-to-future orientation positively modulated the magnitude of grid-cell-like representation in the left entorhinal cortex. Our findings suggest that temporal processing may be supported by spatially modulated systems, and that innate regularities of abstract domains may interface and alter grid-cell-like representations, similarly to spatial geometry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dose-dependent suppression of hippocampal contextual memory formation, place cells, and spatial engrams by the NMDAR antagonist (R)-CPP</a></h4>

              
                A common way to study the functional importance of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in hippocampal memory-encoding circuits is by administering NMDAR antagonists. We recently compared the effects of (R,S)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), a competitive NMDAR antagonist, on suppression of memory in vivo versus suppression of NMDAR-mediated field EPSPs (fEPSPNMDA) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in vitro. Surprisingly, we found that concentrations that block contextual conditioning in vivo are ineffective at blocking the fEPSPNMDA or LTP in vitro. Here we tested one possible explanation for the mismatch--that the hippocampus is relatively resistant to CPP compared to other brain structures engaged in contextual fear conditioning. We used the context pre-exposure facilitation effect (CPFE) paradigm to isolate the hippocampal component of contextual learning, and in-vivo calcium imaging of place cells and spatial engrams to directly assess hippocampal spatial coding. We found that, by both measures, the active enantiomer (R)-CPP did interfere with hippocampal function at concentrations below those that block fEPSPs or LTP. We conclude that the alternative--that CPP interferes with memory by targeting NMDARs in interneurons rather than pyramidal neurons--is the more likely explanation.
