The field of medical imaging, where AI systems are beginning to be increasingly adopted, is no exception. Here we discuss the meaning of fairness in this area and comment on the potential sources of biases, as well as the strategies available to mitigate them. Finally, we analyze the current state of the field, identifying strengths and highlighting areas of vacancy, challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Towards Detailed Cortical Maps of the Human Back with Representational Similarity Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cortical reorganization and its potential pathological significance is increasingly studied in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. Yet, detailed cortical maps of the healthy human back are lacking. To better understand cortical changes during the development and maintenance of CLBP, a detailed baseline characterization resulting from sensory thoracolumbar afferent input is needed. To this end, a novel pneumatic vibrotactile stimulation method was used to stimulate paraspinal sensory afferents while studying their cortical representations in unprecedented detail. Methods: In 30 young healthy participants, vibrotactile stimulations at 20Hz and 80Hz were applied bilaterally at nine locations along the thoracolumbar axis while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed. A whole-brain searchlight representational similarity analysis (RSA) in combination with different experimental models of paraspinal afferent input was used to investigate the representational organization of the respective neuronal activation patterns. Results: For 80Hz, the organizational structure of the neuronal activation patterns yielded the best fit for a model based on segmental distances between the stimulated paraspinal locations, located bilaterally in the primary (S1) and secondary somatosensory (S2) cortices. For 20Hz, this observation was restricted to the right S1. Conclusions: fMRI during paraspinal vibrotactile stimulation in combination with RSA is a powerful tool that can be used to establish highly detailed cortical maps of the human back. The current findings constitute a promising basis to further explore cortical reorganization and its potential pathological meaning in CLBP patients.

                Recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to decode and synthesize various aspects of acoustic speech directly from intracranial measurements of electrophysiological brain activity. In order to continue progressing toward the development of a practical speech neuroprosthesis for the individuals with speech impairments, better understanding and modeling of imagined speech processes are required. The present study uses intracranial brain recordings from participants that performed a speaking task with trials consisting of overt, mouthed, and imagined speech, representing various degrees of decreasing behavioral output. Speech activity detection models are constructed using spatial, spectral, and temporal brain activity features, and the features and model performances are characterized and compared across the three degrees of behavioral output. The results indicate there is a hierarchy in which the relevant channels for the lower behavioral output modes form nested subsets of the relevant channels from the higher behavioral output modes. This provides important insights for the elusive goal of developing more effective imagined speech decoding models with respect to the better-established overt speech decoding counterparts.

                There is a strong male bias in the prevalence of many neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder. However, the mechanisms underlying this sex bias remain elusive. Infection during the perinatal period is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorder development. Here, we used a mouse model of early-life immune activation that reliably induces deficits in social behaviors only in males. We demonstrate that male-biased alterations in social behavior are dependent upon microglial immune signaling and are coupled to alterations in mitochondrial morphology, gene expression, and function specifically within microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain. Additionally, we show that this behavioral and microglial mitochondrial vulnerability to early-life immune activation is programmed by the male-typical perinatal gonadal hormone surge. These findings demonstrate that social behavior in males over the lifespan are regulated by microglia-specific mechanisms that are shaped by events that occur in early development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Low-level tuning biases in higher visual cortex reflect the semantic informativeness of visual features</a></h4>

              
                Representations of visual and semantic information can overlap in human visual cortex, with the same neural populations exhibiting sensitivity to low-level features (orientation, spatial frequency, retinotopic position), and high-level semantic categories (faces, scenes). It has been hypothesized that this relationship between low-level visual and high-level category neural selectivity reflects natural scene statistics, such that neurons in a given category-selective region are tuned for low-level features or spatial positions that are diagnostic of the region's preferred category. To address the generality of this "natural scene statistics" hypothesis, as well as how well it can account for responses to complex naturalistic images across visual cortex, we performed two complementary analyses. First, across a large set of rich natural scene images, we demonstrated reliable associations between low-level (Gabor) features and high-level semantic dimensions (indoor-outdoor, animacy, real-world size), with these relationships varying spatially across the visual field. Second, we used a large-scale fMRI dataset (the Natural Scenes Dataset) and a voxelwise forward encoding model to estimate the feature and spatial selectivity of neural populations throughout visual cortex. We found that voxels in category-selective visual regions exhibit systematic biases in their feature and spatial selectivity which are consistent with their hypothesized roles in category processing. We further showed that these low-level tuning biases are largely independent of viewed image category. Together, our results are consistent with a framework in which low-level feature selectivity contributes to the computation of high-level semantic category information in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A general theory of multistable systems in pathophysiology [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite intensive investigations numerous diseases remain etiologically puzzling and recalcitrant to treatments. A theory is proposed here assuming that these difficulties are due to an unsuitable approach to the mechanisms of life, which is subjugated by an apparent complexity and fails to grasp the uniformity that lays behind. The stability of metabolism, despite the enormous complex of chemical reactions, suggests that reciprocal control is a prerequisite of life. Negative feedback loops have been known for a long time to maintain homeostasis, while more recently, different life processes involved in transitions or changes have been modeled by positive loops giving rise to bistable switches, also including various diseases. The present theory makes a generalization, by assuming that any functional element of a biological system is involved in a positive or a negative feedback loop. Consequently, the theory holds that the starting mechanism of any disease that affects a healthy human can be conceptually reduced to a bistable or multistationary loop system, thus providing a unifying model leading to the discovery of critical therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantification of hypoxic regions distant from occlusions in cerebral penetrating arteriole trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yidan Xue, Theodosia Georgakopoulou, Anne-Eva van der Wijk, Tamás I. Józsa, Ed van Bavel, Stephen J. Payne</p>

The microvasculature plays a key role in oxygen transport in the mammalian brain. Despite the close coupling between cerebral vascular geometry and local oxygen demand, recent experiments have reported that microvascular occlusions can lead to unexpected distant tissue hypoxia and infarction. To better understand the spatial correlation between the hypoxic regions and the occlusion sites, we used both <i>in vivo</i> experiments and <i>in silico</i> simulations to investigate the effects of occlusions in cerebral penetrating arteriole trees on tissue hypoxia. In a rat model of microembolisation, 25 μm microspheres were injected through the carotid artery to occlude penetrating arterioles. In representative models of human cortical columns, the penetrating arterioles were occluded by simulating the transport of microspheres of the same size and the oxygen transport was simulated using a Green’s function method. The locations of microspheres and hypoxic regions were segmented, and two novel distance analyses were implemented to study their spatial correlation. The distant hypoxic regions were found to be present in both experiments and simulations, and mainly due to the hypoperfusion in the region downstream of the occlusion site. Furthermore, a reasonable agreement for the spatial correlation between hypoxic regions and occlusion sites is shown between experiments and simulations, which indicates the good applicability of <i>in silico</i> models in understanding the response of cerebral blood flow and oxygen transport to microemboli.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Signal neutrality, scalar property, and collapsing boundaries as consequences of a learned multi-timescale strategy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luca Manneschi, Guido Gigante, Eleni Vasilaki, Paolo Del Giudice</p>

We postulate that three fundamental elements underlie a decision making process: perception of time passing, information processing in multiple timescales and reward maximisation. We build a simple reinforcement learning agent upon these principles that we train on a random dot-like task. Our results, similar to the experimental data, demonstrate three emerging signatures. (1) signal neutrality: insensitivity to the signal coherence in the interval preceding the decision. (2) Scalar property: the mean of the response times varies widely for different signal coherences, yet the shape of the distributions stays almost unchanged. (3) Collapsing boundaries: the “effective” decision-making boundary changes over time in a manner reminiscent of the theoretical optimal. Removing the perception of time or the multiple timescales from the model does not preserve the distinguishing signatures. Our results suggest an alternative explanation for signal neutrality. We propose that it is not part of motor planning. It is part of the decision-making process and emerges from information processing on multiple timescales.

   <div>
    The loss of detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered a functional cure in chronic hepatitis B. Naturally, HBsAg can be incorporated into the virion envelope or assembled into subviral particles (SVPs) with lipid from host cells. Until now, there has been no detailed structure of HBsAg, and the published SVP structures are controversial. Here, we report the first subnanometer-resolution structures of spherical SVP from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the related woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) determined by cryo–electron microscopy in combination with AlphaFold2 prediction. Both structures showed unique rhombicuboctahedral symmetry with 24 protruding spikes comprising dimer of small HBsAg with four helical domains. The lipid moiety in the SVP is organized in a noncanonical lipid patch instead of a lipid bilayer, which can accommodate the exposed hydrophobic surface and modulate particle stability. Together, these findings advance our knowledge of viral membrane organization and the structures of HBV and WHV spherical SVPs.

    Abstract

   <div>
    A large discrepancy between simulated and observed black carbon (BC) surface concentrations over the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) has so far limited our ability to assess the magnitude of BC health impacts in terms of population exposure, morbidity, and mortality. We evaluate these impacts using an integrated modeling framework, including successfully predicted BC concentrations. Population exposure to BC is notable, with more than 60 million people identified as living in hotspots of BC concentration (wintertime mean, &gt;20 μg m
    <sup>
     −3
    </sup>
    ). The attributable fraction of the total cardiovascular disease mortality (CVM) burden to BC exposures is 62% for the megacity. The semiurban area comprised about 49% of the total BC-attributable CVM burden over the IGP. More than 400,000 lives can potentially be saved from CVM annually by implementing prioritized emission reduction from the combustion of domestic biofuel in the semiurban area, diesel oil in transportation, and coal in thermal power plant and brick kiln industries in megacities.

    Protein linkages to filamentous (F)–actin provide the cell membrane with mechanical stability and support intricate membrane architectures. However, the actin cytoskeleton is highly dynamic and undergoes rapid changes in shape during cell motility and other processes. The molecular mechanisms that generate a mechanically robust yet fluid connection between the membrane and actin cytoskeleton remain poorly understood. Here, we adapted a single-molecule optical trap assay to examine how the prototypical membrane-actin linker ezrin acts to anchor F-actin to the cell membrane. We find that ezrin forms a complex that slides along F-actin over micrometer distances while resisting detachment by forces oriented perpendicular to the filament axis. The ubiquity of ezrin and analogous proteins suggests that sliding anchors such as ezrin may constitute an important but overlooked element in the construction of the actin cytoskeleton.

    Improving the thermal stability of biologics, including vaccines, is critical to reduce the economic costs and health risks associated with the cold chain. Here, we designed a versatile, safe, and easy-to-use reversible PEG-based hydrogel platform formed via dynamic covalent boronic ester cross-linking for the encapsulation, stabilization, and on-demand release of biologics. Using these reversible hydrogels, we thermally stabilized a wide range of biologics up to 65°C, including model enzymes, heat-sensitive clinical diagnostic enzymes (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase I), protein-based vaccines (H5N1 hemagglutinin), and whole viruses (adenovirus type 5). Our data support a generalized protection mechanism for the thermal stabilization of diverse biologics using direct encapsulation in reversible hydrogels. Furthermore, preliminary toxicology data suggest that the components of our hydrogel are safe for in vivo use. Our reversible hydrogel platform offers a simple material solution to mitigate the costs and risks associated with reliance on a continuous cold chain for biologic transport and storage.

    Spin-phonon coupling is the main driver of spin relaxation and decoherence in solid-state semiconductors at finite temperature. Controlling this interaction is a central problem for many disciplines, ranging from magnetic resonance to quantum technologies. Spin relaxation theories have been developed for almost a century but often use a phenomenological description of phonons and their coupling to spin, resulting in a nonpredictive tool and hindering our detailed understanding of spin dynamics. Here, we combine time-local master equations up to the fourth order with advanced electronic structure methods and perform predictions of spin-phonon relaxation time for a series of solid-state coordination compounds based on both transition metals and lanthanide Kramers ions. The agreement between experiments and simulations demonstrates that an accurate, universal, and fully ab initio implementation of spin relaxation theory is possible, thus paving the way to a systematic study of spin-phonon relaxation in solid-state materials.

    Although the continuous-variable position-momentum entanglement of photon pairs produced by parametric down-conversion has applicability in several quantum information applications, it is not suitable for applications involving long-distance propagation. This is because entanglement in the position-momentum bases, as seen through Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)–correlation measurements, decays very rapidly with photons propagating away from the source. In contrast, in this article, we show that in the continuous-variable bases of angle–orbital angular momentum (OAM), the entanglement, as seen through EPR-correlation measurements, exhibits a remarkably different behavior. As with the position-momentum bases, initially, the entanglement in the angle-OAM bases also decays with propagation, and after a few centimeters of propagation, there is no angle-OAM entanglement left. However, as the photons continue to travel further away from the source, the entanglement in the angle-OAM bases revives. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate this behavior and show that angle-OAM entanglement revives even in the presence of strong turbulence.

   <div>
    Trained immunity describes the capacity of innate immune cells to develop heterologous memory in response to certain exogenous exposures. This phenomenon mediates, at least in part, the beneficial off-target effects of the BCG vaccine. Using an in vitro model of trained immunity, we show that BCG exposure induces a persistent change in active histone modifications, DNA methylation, transcription, and adenosine-to-inosine RNA modification in human monocytes. By profiling DNA methylation of circulating monocytes from infants in the MIS BAIR clinical trial, we identify a BCG-associated DNA methylation signature that persisted more than 12 months after neonatal BCG vaccination. Genes associated with this epigenetic signature are involved in viral response pathways, consistent with the reported off-target protection against viral infections in neonates, adults, and the elderly. Our findings indicate that the off-target effects of BCG in infants are accompanied by epigenetic remodeling of circulating monocytes that lasts more than 1 year.

    Protein condensation into liquid-like structures is critical for cellular compartmentalization, RNA processing, and stress response. Research on protein condensation has primarily focused on membraneless organelles in the absence of lipids. However, the cellular cytoplasm is full of lipid interfaces, yet comparatively little is known about how lipids affect protein condensation. Here, we show that nonspecific interactions between lipids and the disordered fused in sarcoma low-complexity (FUS LC) domain strongly affect protein condensation. In the presence of anionic lipids, FUS LC formed lipid-protein clusters at concentrations more than 30-fold lower than required for pure FUS LC. Lipid-triggered FUS LC clusters showed less dynamic protein organization than canonical, lipid-free FUS LC condensates. Lastly, we found that phosphatidylserine membranes promoted FUS LC condensates having β sheet structures, while phosphatidylglycerol membranes initiated unstructured condensates. Our results show that lipids strongly influence FUS LC condensation, suggesting that protein-lipid interactions modulate condensate formation in cells.

    Neuroinflammation leads to neuronal stress responses that contribute to neuronal dysfunction and loss. However, treatments that stabilize neurons and prevent their destruction are still lacking. Here, we identify the histone methyltransferase G9a as a druggable epigenetic regulator of neuronal vulnerability to inflammation. In murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and human multiple sclerosis (MS), we found that the G9a-catalyzed repressive epigenetic mark H3K9me2 was robustly induced by neuroinflammation. G9a activity repressed anti-ferroptotic genes, diminished intracellular glutathione levels, and triggered the iron-dependent programmed cell death pathway ferroptosis. Conversely, pharmacological treatment of EAE mice with a G9a inhibitor restored anti-ferroptotic gene expression, reduced inflammation-induced neuronal loss, and improved clinical outcome. Similarly, neuronal anti-ferroptotic gene expression was reduced in MS brain tissue and was boosted by G9a inhibition in human neuronal cultures. This study identifies G9a as a critical transcriptional enhancer of neuronal ferroptosis and potential therapeutic target to counteract inflammation-induced neurodegeneration.

    We combine monazite petrochronology with thermal modeling to evaluate the relative roles of crustal melting, surface denudation, and tectonics in facilitating ultrafast exhumation of the Nanga Parbat Massif in the western Himalayan syntaxis. Our results reveal diachronous melting histories between samples and a pulse of ultrafast exhumation (9 to 13 mm/year) that began ~1 Ma and was preceded by several million years of slower, but still rapid, exhumation (2 to 5 mm/year). Recent studies show that an exhumation pulse of similar timing and magnitude occurred in the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. A synchronous exhumation pulse in both Himalayan syntaxes suggests that neither erosion by rivers and/or glaciers nor a pulse of crustal melting was a primary trigger for accelerated exhumation. Rather, our results, combined with those of recent studies in the eastern syntaxis, imply that larger-scale tectonic processes impose the dominant control on the current tempo of rapid exhumation in the Himalayan syntaxes.

    Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a distinct component of Earth’s hydrosphere and provides a link between the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nutrients, and trace metals (TMs). Binding of TMs to DOM is thought to result in a TM pool with DOM-like biogeochemistry. Here, we determined elemental stoichiometries of aluminum, iron, copper, nickel, zinc, cobalt, and manganese associated with a fraction of the DOM pool isolated by solid-phase extraction at ambient pH (DOM
    <sub>
     SPE-amb
    </sub>
    ) from the Amazon plume. We found that the rank order of TM stoichiometry within the DOM
    <sub>
     SPE-amb
    </sub>
    fraction was underpinned by the chemical periodicity of the TM. Furthermore, the removal of the TM
    <sub>
     SPE-amb
    </sub>
    pool at low salinity was related to the chemical hardness of the TM ion. Thus, the biogeochemistry of TMs bound to the DOM
    <sub>
     SPE-amb
    </sub>
    component in the Amazon plume was determined by the chemical nature of the TM and not by that of the DOM

                Background: Acute renal transplant rejection is believed to be an immunological phenomenon and is one of the most serious consequences of transplantation as a treatment for end-stage renal illness. In recent decades, numerous research has been conducted to investigate the relationship between cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 +49A/G (CTLA-4 +49A/G) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the likelihood of rejection; nevertheless, the results are still controversial, and inconsistency has been documented among investigations. Consequently, the purpose of the present investigation was to conduct a study on the relation between CTLA-4 +49A/G polymorphism and risk of transplant rejection.  Methods: The study was reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Retrospective and prospective analytical randomized control trial (RCTs) published prints from Embase, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of science were included to the study in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The search was conducted on February 2nd, 2022, using the search term (cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-antigen-4 OR CTLA-4) AND (gene polymorphism OR single nucleotide polymorphisms OR allele OR alleles OR genotype OR genotypes) AND (renal OR kidney) AND (transplant OR transplantation) AND (acute rejection).  Results: The CTLA-4 G-allele/GG-genotype was more likely to be related to renal transplantation rejection risk. It was found with odds ratio (OR) in overall analysis of G vs. A-allele was 1.22 (95%CI 1.05-1.42; p-value=0.01) and the OR of GG vs. AG+AA-genotype was 1.47 (95%CI 1.14-1.89; p-value=0.003). However, the AA-genotype was not associated with renal transplantation rejection risk. The interesting finding in this study was the association of the SNPs and rejection of renal transplantation was especially found in Asian sub-analysis.  Conclusions: Consequently, the CTLA-4 G-allele/GG-genotype is related to the likelihood of rejection in patients underwent renal transplantation.

                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a challenging pandemic globally. The clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure. In-hospital mortality varies from 18.9% to 20.3%. Old age, male gender, co-morbidities, lower oxygen saturation, lymphopenia, raised C-reactive protein, and d-dimer levels increase the risk of critical illness and death. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and associated outcomes in a tertiary level hospital in Nepal. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary center of Nepal during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. A non-probabilistic consecutive sampling technique was adopted. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM-SPSS), version-23. Mortality (yes/no) was the primary outcome of interest, and accordingly, the cases were divided into two groups, survivors and non-survivors. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: The overall in-hospital mortality was 84 (19.58%), and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality was 36 (58.06%). The death rate was higher in cases presenting with shortness of breath and anorexia. Hypoxemic respiratory failure (16.08%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (8.62%) were the most common complications associated with higher mortality. Patients with older age had higher odds of mortality (adjusted OR, 1.077; p<0.001). The risk of mortality was higher in severe to critically ill patients (adjusted OR, 5.861; p=0.001), and those who were under mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR, 39.059; p<0.001). Likewise, the duration of hospital stay was significantly associated with mortality (adjusted OR, 0.795; p<0.001). Conclusions: The non-survivors of COVID-19 tended to be of older age, severe to critically ill at presentation, require mechanical ventilation, and have a shorter duration of hospital stay, compared to survivors. So, these groups of patients need special care and support during hospital admission.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is ultimately fatal. Currently, millions of Americans are living with AD, and this number is predicted to grow with increases in the aging population. Interestingly, despite the prevalence of AD in human populations, the full AD phenotype has not been observed in any nonhuman primate (NHP) species, and it has been suggested that NHPs are immune to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.</p>
<p>Here, we review the typical age-related changes and pathologies in humans along with the neuropathologic changes associated with AD, and we place this information in the context of the comparative neuropathology of NHPs. We further propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell technology as a way of addressing initial molecular processes and changes that occur in neurons and glia (in both humans and NHPs) when exposed to AD-inducing pathology prior to cell death.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The structure of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in rod and cone photoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels play a central role in rod and cone photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina. In photoreceptors, light triggers a series of biochemical reactions that ultimately close CNG channels and evoke a brief voltage pulse, a signal that is later passed on to the brain. Malfunction of CNG channels can lead to loss of vision. Thus, understanding their function in atomic and mechanistic detail is important. Because of the complex subunit stoichiometry of these channels, elucidation of their structure has proved challenging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Allosteric stabilization of calcium and phosphoinositide dual binding engages several synaptotagmins in fast exocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic communication relies on the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, which leads to neurotransmitter release. This exocytosis is triggered by brief and local elevations of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with remarkably high sensitivity. How this is molecularly achieved is unknown. While synaptotagmins confer the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of neurotransmitter exocytosis, biochemical measurements reported Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinities too low to account for synaptic function. However, synaptotagmin's Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity increases upon binding the plasma membrane phospholipid PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and, vice versa, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding increases synaptotagmin's PI(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>affinity, indicating a stabilization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dual-bound syt. Here we devise a molecular exocytosis model based on this positive allosteric stabilization and the assumptions that (1.) synaptotagmin Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dual binding lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion and that (2.) the effect of multiple synaptotagmins on the energy barrier is additive. The model, which relies on biochemically measured Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>affinities and protein copy numbers, reproduced the steep Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependency of neurotransmitter release. Our results indicate that each synaptotagmin dual binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion by ~5 k<sub>B</sub>T and that allosteric stabilization of this state enables the synchronized engagement of several (typically three) synaptotagmins for fast exocytosis. Furthermore, we show that mutations altering synaptotagmin’s allosteric properties may show dominant-negative effects, even though synaptotagmins act independently on the energy barrier, and that dynamic changes of local PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (e.g. upon vesicle movement) dramatically impact synaptic responses. We conclude that allosterically stabilized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dual binding enables synaptotagmins to exert their coordinated function in neurotransmission.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A computational account of why more valuable goals seem to require more effortful actions</a></h4>

              
                To decide whether a course of action is worth pursuing, individuals typically weigh its expected costs and benefits. Optimal decision-making relies upon accurate effort cost anticipation, which is generally assumed to be performed independently from goal valuation. In two experiments (n = 46), we challenged this independence principle of standard decision theory. We presented participants with a series of treadmill routes randomly associated to monetary rewards and collected both ‘accept’ versus ‘decline’ decisions and subjective estimates of energetic cost. Behavioural results show that higher monetary prospects led participants to provide higher cost estimates, although reward was independent from effort in our design. Among candidate cognitive explanations, they support a model in which prospective cost assessment is biased by the output of an automatic computation adjusting effort expenditure to goal value. This decision bias might lead people to abandon the pursuit of valuable goals that are in fact not so costly to achieve.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">trim-21 promotes proteasomal degradation of CED-1 for apoptotic cell clearance in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                The phagocytic receptor CED-1 mediates apoptotic cell recognition by phagocytic cells, enabling cell corpse clearance in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Whether appropriate levels of CED-1 are maintained for executing the engulfment function remains unknown. Here, we identified the <i>C. elegans</i> E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif containing-21 (TRIM-21) as a component of the CED-1 pathway for apoptotic cell clearance. When the NPXY motif of CED-1 was bound to the adaptor protein CED-6 or the YXXL motif of CED-1 was phosphorylated by tyrosine kinase SRC-1 and subsequently bound to the adaptor protein NCK-1 containing the SH2 domain, TRIM-21 functioned in conjunction with UBC-21 to catalyze K48-linked poly-ubiquitination on CED-1, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. In the absence of TRIM-21, CED-1 accumulated post-translationally and drove cell corpse degradation defects, as evidenced by direct binding to VHA-10. These findings reveal a unique mechanism for the maintenance of appropriate levels of CED-1 to regulate apoptotic cell clearance.

                Systematic analysis of rich behavioral recordings is being used to uncover how circuits encode complex behaviors. Here we apply this approach to embryos. What are the first embryonic behaviors and how do they evolve as early neurodevelopment ensues? To address these questions, we present a systematic description of behavioral maturation for Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Posture libraries were built using a genetically encoded motion capture suit imaged with light-sheet microscopy and annotated using custom tracking software. Analysis of cell trajectories, postures, and behavioral motifs revealed a stereotyped developmental progression. Early movement is dominated by flipping between dorsal and ventral coiling, which gradually slows into a period of reduced motility. Late-stage embryos exhibit sinusoidal waves of dorsoventral bends, prolonged bouts of directed motion, and a rhythmic pattern of pausing, which we designate slow wave twitch (SWT). Synaptic transmission is required for late-stage motion but not for early flipping nor the intervening inactive phase. A high-throughput behavioral assay and calcium imaging revealed that SWT is elicited by the rhythmic activity of a quiescence-promoting neuron (RIS). Similar periodic quiescent states are seen prenatally in diverse animals and may play an important role in promoting normal developmental outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Septin7 is indispensable for proper skeletal muscle architecture and function</a></h4>

              
                Today septins are considered as the fourth component of the cytoskeleton, with the Septin7 isoform playing a critical role in the formation of higher-order structures. While its importance has already been confirmed in several intracellular processes of different organs, very little is known about its role in skeletal muscle. Here, using Septin7 conditional knockdown (KD) mouse model, the C2C12 cell line, and enzymatically isolated adult muscle fibers, the organization and localization of septin filaments are revealed, and an ontogenesis-dependent expression of Septin7 is demonstrated. KD mice displayed a characteristic hunchback phenotype with skeletal deformities, reduction in in vivo and in vitro force generation, and disorganized mitochondrial networks. Furthermore, knockout of Septin7 in C2C12 cells resulted in complete loss of cell division while KD cells provided evidence that Septin7 is essential for proper myotube differentiation. These and the transient increase in Septin7 expression following muscle injury suggest that it may be involved in muscle regeneration and development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An auto-inhibited state of protein kinase G and implications for selective activation</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) are key mediators of the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway that regulates biological functions as diverse as smooth muscle contraction, cardiac function, and axon guidance. Understanding how cGMP differentially triggers mammalian PKG isoforms could lead to new therapeutics that inhibit or activate PKGs, complementing drugs that target nitric oxide synthases and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases in this signaling axis. Alternate splicing of PRKG1 transcripts confers distinct leucine zippers, linkers, and auto-inhibitory pseudo-substrate sequences to PKG Iα and Iβ that result in isoform-specific activation properties, but the mechanism of enzyme auto-inhibition and its alleviation by cGMP is not well understood. Here we present a crystal structure of PKG Iβ in which the auto-inhibitory sequence and the cyclic nucleotide binding domains are bound to the catalytic domain, providing a snapshot of the auto-inhibited state. Specific contacts between the PKG Iβ auto-inhibitory sequence and the enzyme active site help explain isoform-specific activation constants and the effects of phosphorylation in the linker. We also present a crystal structure of a PKG I cyclic nucleotide binding domain with an activating mutation linked to Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections. Similarity of this structure to wild type cGMP-bound domains and differences with the auto-inhibited enzyme provide a mechanistic basis for constitutive activation. We show that PKG Iβ auto-inhibition is mediated by contacts within each monomer of the native full-length dimeric protein, and using the available structural and biochemical data we develop a model for the regulation and cooperative activation of PKGs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Antiretroviral treatment reveals a novel role for lysosomes in oligodendrocyte maturation</a></h4>

              
                White matter deficits are a common neuropathologic finding in neurologic disorders, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In HAND, the persistence of white matter alterations despite suppressive antiretroviral (ARV) therapy suggests that ARVs may be directly contributing to these impairments. Here, we report that a frontline ARV, bictegravir (BIC), significantly attenuates remyelination following cuprizone-mediated demyelination, a model that recapitulates acute demyelination, but has no impact on already formed mature myelin. Mechanistic studies in vitro revealed that treatment with BIC leads to significant decrease in mature oligodendrocytes accompanied by lysosomal de-acidification and impairment of lysosomal degradative capacity with no alterations in lysosomal membrane permeability or total lysosome number. Activation of the endolysosomal cation channel TRPML1 prevents both lysosomal de-acidification and impairment of oligodendrocyte differentiation by BIC. Lastly, we show that de-acidification of lysosomes by compounds that raise lysosomal pH is sufficient to prevent maturation of oligodendrocytes. Overall, this study has uncovered a critical role for lysosomal acidification in modulating oligodendrocyte function and has implications for neurologic diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and white matter abnormalities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Canonical Response Parameterization: Quantifying the structure of responses to single-pulse intracranial electrical brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Single-pulse electrical stimulation in the nervous system, often called cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) measurement, is an important technique to understand how brain regions interact with one another. Voltages are measured from implanted electrodes in one brain area while stimulating another with brief current impulses separated by several seconds. Historically, researchers have tried to understand the significance of evoked voltage polyphasic deflections by visual inspection, but no general-purpose tool has emerged to understand their shapes or describe them mathematically. We describe and illustrate a new technique to parameterize brain stimulation data, where voltage response traces are projected into one another using a semi-normalized dot product. The length of timepoints from stimulation included in the dot product is varied to obtain a temporal profile of structural significance, and the peak of the profile uniquely identifies the duration of the response. Using linear kernel PCA, a canonical response shape is obtained over this duration, and then single-trial traces are parameterized as a projection of this canonical shape with a residual term. Such parameterization allows for dissimilar trace shapes from different brain areas to be directly compared by quantifying cross-projection magnitudes, response duration, canonical shape projection amplitudes, signal-to-noise ratios, explained variance, and statistical significance. Artifactual trials are automatically identified by outliers in sub-distributions of cross-projection magnitude, and rejected. This technique, which we call "Canonical Response Parameterization" (CRP) dramatically simplifies the study of CCEP shapes, and may also be applied in a wide range of other settings involving event-triggered data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The medial entorhinal cortex is necessary for the stimulus control over hippocampal place fields by distal, but not proximal, landmarks</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental property of place cells in the hippocampus is the anchoring of their firing fields to salient landmarks within the environment. However, it is unclear how such information reaches the hippocampus. In the current experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the stimulus control exerted by distal visual landmarks requires input from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Place cells were recorded from mice with ibotenic acid lesions of the MEC (n = 7) and from sham-lesioned mice (n = 6) following 90{degrees} rotations of either distal landmarks or proximal cues in a cue controlled environment. We found that lesions of the MEC impaired the anchoring of place fields to distal landmarks, but not proximal cues. We also observed that, relative to sham-lesioned mice, place cells in animals with MEC lesions exhibited significantly reduced spatial information and increased sparsity. These results support the view that distal landmark information reaches the hippocampus via the MEC, but that proximal cue information can do so via an alternative neural pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential processing of decision information in subregions of rodent medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making involves multiple cognitive processes requiring different aspects of information about the situation at hand. The rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been hypothesized to be central to these abilities. Functional studies have sought to link specific processes to specific anatomical subregions, but past studies of mPFC have yielded controversial results, leaving the precise nature of mPFC function unclear. To settle this debate, we recorded from the full dorso-ventral extent of mPFC in each of 8 rats, as they performed a complex economic decision task. These data revealed four distinct functional domains within mPFC that closely mirrored anatomically-identified subregions, including novel evidence to divide prelimbic cortex into dorsal and ventral components. We found that dorsal aspects of mPFC (ACC, dPL) processed information about active decisions, while ventral aspects (vPL, IL) were more engaged in motivational factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic delineation of signaling and epigenomic mechanisms underlying microglia inflammatory activity in acute and chronic brain pathologies</a></h4>

              
                Microglia promptly mount an inflammatory response following detection of infectious agents or injuries in the central nervous system. Such function fundamentally depends upon dynamic modulation of gene expression. However, the signaling and epigenomic mechanisms that regulate the transcriptional process underlying microglial inflammatory activity are not well understood. To address this, we used RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq to delineate gene signatures and activity across the repertoire of genomic regulatory elements of microglia engaged in acute and chronic neuroinflammatory activity. Systematic interrogations of the microglial population over time during a systemic inflammatory response revealed a coordinated, sequential activation of multiple gene programs associated with defense response, translation and cell cycling. Activation of these programs occurred in parallel with gain and loss of activity at 4,080 and 3,119 genomic cis-regulatory elements, respectively. Furthermore, computational analyses identified key transcriptional regulators, including Ets, AP-1, C/epb, Nf-kappaB, Irf, Runx, c-Myc and E2f family members, that display differential propensity for activity at gene promoters and promoter-distal cis-regulatory elements. Gene expression analyses also suggested that the transcriptional process likely contribute to the effective activity of numerous transcriptional regulators through the modulation of their mRNA levels. Finally, characterization of CD11c-positive microglia that emerge with chronic demyelinating brain lesions suggested that Egr2, Mef2 members and E-box-binding factors such as Tfeb and Mitf contribute to the enhanced phagosomal activity of this inflammatory subset. Loss-of-function experiments validated that Mef2a in microglia is necessary for the acquisition of the CD11c-positive phenotype. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the inflammatory activity of microglia arises through an intricate, ultimately context-dependent, interplay between signaling pathways, genomic regulatory elements and the transcriptional machinery.

                Ventilation is regulated across many systems, with respiratory rhythm formation occurring in the brainstem but modulated in response to: chemoreception, respiratory muscle afferents, and volitional control. Alterations within any of these systems may result in disruptions of appropriate respiratory control and ultimately, disease. The apolipoprotein (APOE) gene has been studied due to its influence on Alzheimer's disease (AD) development and work in an APOE mouse model recently demonstrated impaired respiratory motor plasticity following spinal cord injury (SCI). Additionally, individuals with AD may co-present with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Despite the prominence of APOE genotype and sex as factors in differing AD and OSA severity, little is known about the impact of these on respiratory control. Using mice expressing two different humanized APOE alleles, we characterized how sex and the presence of E3 or E4 alleles influenced ventilation during baseline (normoxia) and during respiratory challenge. We show that sex and genotype influence breathing under hypoxia, which may have clinical implications in the context of AD and OSA. Additionally, female mice, while responding robustly to hypoxia, were unable to recover to baseline respiratory levels, emphasizing sex differences in disordered breathing and potentially indicative of high metabolic cost.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Clarifying the role of an unavailable distractor alternative in human multiattribute choice</a></h4>

              
                Decisions between two alternatives can be influenced by a third irrelevant decoy alternative. Although decoy effects typically depend on the decoy's relative position in a multiattribute choice space, recent studies using risky prospects (i.e., varying in reward and probability) reported a novel 'positive' decoy effect operating on a single value dimension: The higher the expected value of an unavailable (distractor) prospect was, the easier the discrimination between two available target prospects became, especially when their expected value difference was small. Here we ask whether this previously reported distractor effect affords alternative interpretations. Indeed, we find that it occurred because the distractor's expected value covaried positively with the subjective utility difference between the two targets. Looking beyond this covariation, we report a modest negative distractor effect, which in turn could conceivably be attributed to classic multiattribute decoy effects. Our findings clarify the modulatory role of an unavailable distracting option in multiattribute decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Faster detection of "darks" than "brights" by monkey superior colliculus neurons</a></h4>

              
                Visual processing is segregated into ON and OFF channels as early as in the retina, and the superficial (output) layers of the primary visual cortex are dominated by neurons preferring dark stimuli. However, it is not clear how the timing of neural processing differs between "darks" and "brights" in general, especially in light of psychophysical evidence; it is also equally not clear how subcortical visual pathways that are critical for active orienting represent stimuli of positive (luminance increments) and negative (luminance decrements) contrast polarity. Here, we recorded from all visually-responsive neuron types in the superior colliculus (SC) of two male rhesus macaque monkeys. We presented a disc (0.51 deg radius) within the response fields (RF's) of neurons, and we varied, across trials, stimulus Weber contrast relative to a gray background. We also varied contrast polarity. There was a large diversity of preferences for darks and brights across the population. However, regardless of individual neural sensitivity, most neurons responded significantly earlier to dark than bright stimuli. This resulted in a dissociation between neural sensitivity and visual response onset latency: a neuron could exhibit a weaker response to a dark stimulus than to a bright stimulus of the same contrast, but it would still have an earlier response to the dark stimulus. Our results highlight an additional candidate visual neural pathway for explaining behavioral differences between the processing of darks and brights, and they demonstrate the importance of temporal aspects in the visual neural code for orienting eye movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An adhesive signaling axis regulates the establishment of the cortical glial scaffold.</a></h4>

              
                The mature mammalian cortex is composed of six architecturally and functionally distinct layers. Two key steps in the assembly of this layered structure are the initial establishment of the glial scaffold and the subsequent migration of post-mitotic neurons to their final position. These processes involve the precise and timely regulation of adhesion and detachment of neural cells from their substrates. Although much is known about the roles of adhesive substrates during neuronal migration and the formation of the glial scaffold, less is understood about how these signals are interpreted and integrated within these neural cells. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that Cas proteins, a family of cytoplasmic adaptors, serve a functional and redundant role during cortical lamination. Cas triple conditional knock-out (Cas TcKO) mice display severe cortical phenotypes that feature cobblestone malformations. Molecular epistasis and genetic experiments suggest that Cas proteins act downstream of transmembrane Dystroglycan and {beta}1-integrin in a radial glial cell-autonomous manner. Overall, these data establish a new and essential role for Cas adaptor proteins during the formation of cortical circuits, and reveal a signaling axis controlling cortical scaffold formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multi-modal fitting approach to construct single-neuron models with patch clamp and high-density microelectrode arrays</a></h4>

              
                In computational neuroscience, multicompartment models are among the most biophysically realistic representations of single neurons. Constructing such models usually involves the use of the patch-clamp technique to record somatic voltage signals under different experimental conditions. The experimental data are then used to fit the many parameters of the model. While patching of the soma is currently the gold-standard approach to build multicompartment models, several studies have also evidenced a richness of dynamics in dendritic and axonal sections. Recording from the soma alone makes it hard to observe and correctly parameterize the activity of non-somatic compartments. In order to provide a richer set of data as input to multicompartment models, we here investigate the combination of somatic patch-clamp recordings with recordings of high-density micro-electrode arrays (HD-MEAs). HD-MEAs enable the observation of extracellular potentials and neural activity of neuronal compartments at sub-cellular resolution. In this work, we introduce a novel framework to combine patch-clamp and HD-MEA data to construct multicompartment models. We first validate our method on a ground-truth model with known parameters and show that the use of features extracted from extracellular signals, in addition to intracellular ones, yields models enabling better fits than using intracellular features alone. We also demonstrate our procedure using experimental data by constructing cell models from in vitro cell cultures. The proposed multi-modal fitting procedure has the potential to augment the modeling efforts of the computational neuroscience community and to provide the field with neuronal models that are more realistic and can be better validated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nonlinear Neural Patterns Are Revealed In High Frequency fNIRS Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Vasomotor tone has a direct implication in oxygen transport to neural tissue, and its dynamics are known to be under constant control from feedback loops with visceral signals, such as sympathovagal interactions. Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers a nuanced measure of hemoglobin concentration that also comprises high frequencies, though most fNIRS literature studies traditional frequency ranges of hemodynamics (< 0.2 Hz). Linear theory of the hemodynamic response function supports this low frequency band, but we hypothesize that nonlinear effects elicited from the complex system sustaining vasomotor tone presents itself in higher frequencies. To characterize these effects, we investigate how plausible modulation of autoregulatory effects impact aforementioned high frequency components of fNIRS through simulations of mechanistic hemodynamic models. Then, we compare representational similarities between fast (0.2 Hz to 0.6 Hz) and slow (< 0.2 Hz) wave fNIRS to demonstrate that representations acquired through nonlinear analysis are distinct between the frequency bands, whereas when using linear time-domain analysis they are not. Furthermore, by comparing topoplots of significant detectors using nonlinear random vector correlation methods (distance correlation), we demonstrate through a 2nd level group analysis that the median concentrations acquired by fNIRS are independent when analyzing the nonlinearity of their dynamics in their fast and slow component, while they are dependent when utilizing linear time-domain analysis. This study not only provides motivation for researchers to also include higher frequency components in their analysis, but also provides motivation to explore nonlinear effects, e.g. topological entropy. The results of this study motivate future research to explore the nonlinear autoregulatory impacts of regional blood flow and hemoglobin concentrations.

                Homeostatic regulation is essential for neuronal function. Several synaptic mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity have been described, but the functional properties of synapses involved in homeostasis are unknown. We used longitudinal two-photon functional imaging of dendritic spine calcium signals in visual and retrosplenial cortices of awake mice to quantify the sensory deprivation-induced changes in the responses of functionally identified spines. We found that spines whose activity selectively correlated with intrinsic network activity underwent TNF- dependent homeostatic increases in their response amplitudes, but spines identified as responsive to sensory stimulation did not. We observed an increase in the global sensory-evoked responses following sensory deprivation, despite the fact that the identified sensory inputs did not strengthen. Instead, global sensory-evoked responses correlated with the strength of network-correlated inputs. Our results suggest that homeostatic regulation of global responses is mediated through changes to intrinsic network-correlated inputs rather than changes to identified sensory inputs thought to drive sensory processing.

                Fluorescent dyes and genetically encoded fluorescence indicators (GEFI) are common tools for visualizing concentration changes of specific ions and messenger molecules during intra- as well as intercellular communication. Using advanced imaging technologies, fluorescence indicators are a prerequisite for the analysis of physiological molecular signaling. Automated detection and analysis of fluorescence signals requires to overcome several challenges, including correct estimation of fluorescence fluctuations at basal concentrations of messenger molecules, detection and extraction of events themselves as well as proper segmentation of neighboring events. Moreover, event detection algorithms need to be sensitive enough to accurately capture localized and low amplitude events exhibiting a limited spatial extent. Here, we present two algorithms (PBasE and CoRoDe) for accurate baseline estimation of fluorescent detection of messenger molecules and automated detection of fluorescence fluctuations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel subtype of reactive astrocytes critical for HIV associated pain pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Pathological pain is common in HIV patients, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive and therapeutic targets for effective treatment have not been identified. Reactive astrocytes are specifically activated in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of HIV patients with pathological pain and required for the development of HIV-associated pain in mouse models. These findings suggest a key role of reactive astrocytes in HIV-associated pain pathogenesis. However, due to the heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes, the pathogenic subtype is unknown. Using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) transcriptomic analysis, we identified a novel subtype of HIV-pain associated astrocytes (HIPAs) in the lumbar spinal cord of the HIV -1 gp120 transgenic model. HIPAs were galectin 3 (Gal3)- positive and had transcriptomic signatures of phagocytosis and inflammation; they were also induced in the spinal cord of HIV patients. We showed HIPAs phagocytosed neuronal and synaptic components and were associated with neuronal degeneration. We found that knockout (KO) of Gal3 in gp120 transgenic mice severely diminished HIPAs. Interestingly, the activation of other astrocytes (e.g., homeostatic astrocytes) were also diminished in the Gla3 KO/gp120 transgenic mice. These results indicate that Gal3 is critical for gp120 to induce HIPAs, and that Gal3 may directly or via HIPAs to control the activation of other subtypes of astrocytes. Finally, we showed that the loss of HIPAs caused by Gal3 KO was associated with attenuated neuronal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and pain in gp120 transgenic mice. Collectively, our data suggest that HIPAs are a Gal3-expressing astrocytic subtype that mediates gp120-induced neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the spinal pain neural circuit during pain pathogenesis and is a potential cell target for treating HIV-associated pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic attention signaling in V4: relation to excitatory/inhibitory cell class and population coupling</a></h4>

              
                Neurons have different roles in attention processing. These roles are determined by a neuron's firing properties, neurotransmitter expression, and functional connectivity. Neurons in the visual cortical area, V4, are reliably engaged by selective attention but exhibit differences in firing rate and correlated variability. It remains unclear what specific neuronal properties shape these attention effects. We identified neurons as fast-spiking (FS) (putative inhibitory) and regular-spiking (RS) (putative excitatory) and investigated their role in anticipatory attention and how this related to their functional connectivity. V4 neurons exhibited a continuum of time-varying attention effects ranging from "restless-weak" neurons at one extreme to "quiet-strong" neurons at another. We found an interdependence between neural attention effects (e.g., restless-weak or quiet-strong), neuron type (FS, RS), and functional connectivity. In particular, we found neurons with restless-weak attention effects were more likely to be RS and have greater population coupling, compared to neurons with other types of attention effects. Also, quiet-strong neurons were more likely to be FS and these FS neurons exhibited higher spike synchrony. From this we propose that time-varying attention effects in a neuronal population depends on the relative involvement of neurons that drive stimulus processing and those that are engaged by intrinsic population activity. These results add important information to our understanding of visual attention circuits at the cellular level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distributed cortical regions for the recall of people, places and objects</a></h4>

              
                Human medial parietal cortex (MPC) is recruited during multiple cognitive. Previously, we demonstrated regions specific to recall of people or places and proposed that the functional organization of MPC mirrors the category selectivity defining the medial-lateral axis of ventral temporal cortex (VTC). However, prior work considered recall of people and places only and VTC also shows object-selectivity sandwiched between face- and scene-selective regions. Here, we tested a strong prediction of our proposal: like VTC, MPC should show a region specifically recruited during object recall, and its relative cortical position should mirror the one of VTC. While responses during people and place recall showed a striking replication of prior findings, we did not observe any evidence for object-recall effects within MPC, which differentiates it from the spatial organization in VTC. Importantly, beyond MPC, robust recall-effects were observed for people, places, and objects on the lateral surface of the brain. Place-recall effects were present in the angular gyrus, frontal eye fields and peripheral portions of early visual cortex, whereas people-recall selectively drove response in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus. Object-recall effects were largely restricted to a region posterior to left somatosensory cortex, in the vicinity of the supramarginal gyrus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that while there are distributed regions active during recall of people, places and objects, the functional organization of MPC does not mirror the medial-lateral axis of VTC but reflects only the most salient features of that axis - namely representations of people and places.

                Natural scenes statistics have been studied extensively using collections of natural images and sound recordings. These studies have yielded important insights about how the brain might exploit regularities and redundancies in visual and auditory stimuli. In contrast, natural scenes for somatosensation have remained largely unexplored. Here we use three-dimensional scans of natural and human-made objects to quantify natural scene statistics at the scale of the human fingertip. Using measurements of distance, slope, and curvature from the object surfaces, we show that the first order statistics follow similar trends as have been observed for images of natural and human-made environments. In addition, independent component analysis of curvature measurements reveals Gabor-like basis vectors similar to those found in natural images. A simple neural model using these filters showed responses that accurately capture the statistics of responses in primate primary somatosensory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Persistent Hypersomnia Following Repetitive Mild Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury: Roles of Chronic Stress and Sex Differences</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often more complicated than a single head injury. An extreme example of this point may be military service members who experience a spectrum of exposures over a prolonged period under stressful conditions. Understanding the effects of complex exposures can support proper evaluation and care for patients experiencing persistent symptoms. We designed a longitudinal series of non-invasive procedures in adult mice to evaluate the effects of prolonged mild exposures. We assessed anxiety, depression, and sleep-wake dysfunction as symptoms that can impact long term outcomes after mild TBI. Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) was generated from a variable sequence of environmental stressors distributed within each of 21 days. Subsequently, mice received a mild blast combined with closed-head mild TBI on five days at 24-hour intervals. TBI components were either five linear force impacts, or a novel alternating repetitive mild TBI (Ar-mTBI) model of linear and rotational (CHIMERA) impacts over five days to produce diffuse pathology. In males and females, UCMS induced anxiety without depressive behavior. Persistent hypersomnia, specifically increased sleep during the active dark period, was found through 6-12 month time points in male mice receiving UCMS with repetitive blast plus TBI events, or surprisingly after UCMS alone. Sleep-wake dysfunction was not found with TBI events alone and was not found in females under any conditions. These results identify prolonged stress and sex differences as important considerations for sleep-wake dysfunction. Furthermore, this reproducible hypersomnia is similar to excessive daytime sleepiness reported in patients, which may inform treatments.

                In this experimental study we demonstrate the influence of contact pressure on porcine postmortem brain tissue impedance using a movable electrode array and a load cell. We show that the variation of the contact pressure between the tissue and the measurement probe leads to a coefficient of variation in the measured impedance of under 3%. Its influence can therefore be neglected. Further, we fit the measured impedances to an equivalent circuit model and compare the resistance as well as the cell density of grey and white matter brain tissue based on the model parameters.

                The central circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a network consisting of various neurons and glia. Individual cells have the autonomous molecular machinery of a cellular clock, but their intrinsic periods are considerably variable. Here, we show that arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons set the ensemble period of the SCN network to control circadian behavior rhythm. Artificial lengthening of cellular periods by deleting casein kinase 1 delta (CK1{delta}) in the whole SCN lengthened the free-running period of behavior rhythm to an extent similar to CK1{delta} deletion specific to AVP neurons. In SCN slices, PER2::LUC reporter rhythms of these mice did not recapitulate the period lengthening. However, in vivo calcium rhythms of both AVP and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons demonstrated lengthened periods similar to the behavioral rhythm upon AVP neuron-specific CK1{delta} deletion. These results indicate that AVP neurons act as the primary determinant of the SCN ensemble period.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Successful reproduction of a large EEG study across software packages</a></h4>

              
                As an active field of research and with the development of state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze EEG datasets, the parametrization of Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis workflows has become increasingly flexible and complex, with a great variety of methodological options and tools to be selected at each step. This high analytical flexibility can be problematic as it can yield to variability in research outcomes. Therefore, growing attention has been recently paid to understand the potential impact of different methodological decisions on the reproducibility of results. In this paper, we aim to examine how sensitive the results of EEG analyses are to variations in preprocessing with different software tools. We reanalyzed the shared EEG data (N=500) from (Williams et al. 2021) using three of the most commonly used EEG software tools: EEGLAB, Brainstorm and FieldTrip. After reproducing the same original preprocessing workflow in each software, the resulting evoked-related potentials (ERPs) were qualitatively and quantitatively compared in order to examine the degree of consistency/discrepancy between softwares. Our findings show a good degree of convergence in terms of the general profile of ERP waveforms, peak latencies and effect size estimates related to specific signal features. However, considerable variability was also observed in the magnitude of the absolute voltage observed with each software package as reflected by the similarity values and observed statistical differences at particular channels and time instants. In conclusion, we believe that this study provides valuable clues to better understand the impact of the software tool on the analysis of EEG results.

                The cerebellum is implicated in drug addiction. However, the cerebellar neuronal circuitry underlying addiction, especially classic pathway of Purkinje cells (PCs) to deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), are largely unknown. Here, tracing experiments showed robust projections from the cerebellar lobule VI tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive PCs (PCTH+) to CaMKII-positive glutamatergic neurons in medial cerebellar nucleus (MedCaMKII), forming PCTH+[boxh]MedCaMKII pathway. Then, mice were subjected to methylamphetamine (METH)-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), showing that METH exposure excited MedCaMKII and inhibited PCTH+. Silencing MedCaMKII by tettox suppressed the formation and expression of METH-induced CPP, but produced serious motor coordination deficits. Chemogenetic activation of lobule VI PCTH+[boxh]Med pathway during METH CPP training blocked the formation and expression of METH-induced CPP without affecting motor coordination, locomotor activity and sucrose reinforcements in mice. Our findings revealed a novel cerebellar lobule VI PCTH+ [boxh]MedCaMKII pathway and pointed out is critical role in encoding METH-preferred behaviors.

                RAS/MAPK gene dysfunction underlies various cancers and neurocognitive disorders. While the role of RAS/MAPK genes have been well studied in cancer, less is known about their function during neurodevelopment. There are many genes that work in concert to regulate RAS/MAPK signaling, suggesting that if common brain phenotypes could be discovered they could have a broad impact on the many other disorders caused by distinct RAS/MAPK genes. We assessed the cellular and molecular consequences of hyperactivating the RAS/MAPK pathway using three distinct genes in a cell type previously implicated in RAS/MAPK-mediated cognitive changes, cortical GABAergic interneurons. We uncovered a spectrum of GABAergic core programs that are commonly altered in each of the mutants. Notably, hyperactive RAS/MAPK mutants bias developing cortical interneurons towards those that are somatostatin+. The increase in somatostatin+ interneurons could also be induced by elevated neural activity and we show the core RAS/MAPK signaling pathway is one mechanism by which this occurs. Overall, these findings present new insights into how different RAS/MAPK mutations can converge on GABAergic interneurons, which may be important for other RAS/MAPK genes/disorders.

	<p> Greater well-being in older adults stems from more effective emotion regulation strategies, highlighting the role of cognitive control. However, cognitive control involves different subsystems, and it is still unclear whether different subsystems have different effects on different emotional information processing. The Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) theory postulates that cognitive control can operate in two distinct modes, namely proactive control (a &amp;amp;ldquo;proactive&amp;amp;rdquo; preparatory mode) and reactive control (a &amp;amp;ldquo;reactive&amp;amp;rdquo; wait-and-see mode). This study created an emotional AX-CPT task to explore differences in cognitive control tradeoff between youth and older adults when processing emotional information. The results found that youth had significantly higher error rates on the emotional-neutral sequence than older adults regardless of the valence of emotional information; only in the negative condition did older adults have higher error rates on both the sad-sad and neutral-sad sequences than youth; this phenomenon was not found in the positive condition. The study showed that, in emotional information processing, youth preferred proactive control over older adults; in negative information processing, older adults preferred reactive control strategies over youth; in positive information processing, older adults showed a similar cognitive control pattern to youth, and proactive control was enhanced.</p>

	<p>With the substantial social and medical burden of addiction, there is considerable interest in understanding risk factors that increase the development of addiction. A key feature of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is compulsive alcohol (EtOH) drinking, where EtOH drinking becomes &amp;amp;ldquo;inflexible&amp;amp;rdquo; after chronic intake, and animals, such as humans with AUD, continue drinking despite aversive consequences. Further, since there is a heritable component to AUD risk, some work has focused on genetically-selected, EtOH-preferring rodents, which could help uncover critical mechanisms driving pathological intake. In this regard, aversion-resistant drinking (ARD) takes &amp;amp;gt;1 month to develop in outbred Wistar rats (and perhaps Sardinian-P EtOH-preferring rats). However, ARD has received limited study in Indiana P-rats, which were selected for high EtOH preference and exhibit factors that could parallel human AUD (including front-loading and impulsivity). Here, we show that P-rats rapidly developed compulsion-like responses for EtOH; 0.4 g/L quinine in EtOH significantly reduced female and male intake on the first day of exposure but had no effect after one week of EtOH drinking (15% EtOH, 24 hr free-choice paradigm). Further, after 4&amp;amp;ndash;5 weeks of EtOH drinking, males but not females showed resistance to even higher quinine (0.5 g/L). Thus, P-rats rapidly developed ARD for EtOH, but only males developed even stronger ARD with further intake. Finally, rats strongly reduced intake of quinine-adulterated water after 1 or 5 weeks of EtOH drinking, suggesting no changes in basic quinine sensitivity. Thus, modeling ARD in P-rats may provide insight into mechanisms underlying genetic predispositions for compulsive drinking and lead to new treatments for AUDs.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a class of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social interactions and communication skills and repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. Rates of ASD diagnosis continue to rise, with current estimates at 1 in 44 children in the US (Maenner 2021). Epidemiological studies have suggested a link between maternal allergic asthma and an increased likelihood of having a child diagnosed with ASD. However, a lack of robust laboratory models prevents mechanistic research from being carried out. We developed a novel mouse model of maternal asthma-allergy (MAA) and previously reported that offspring from these mothers exhibit behavioral deficits compared to controls. In addition, it was shown that epigenetic regulation of gene expression in microglia was altered in these offspring, including several autism candidate genes. To further elucidate if there is neuroinflammation in the fetus following MAA, we investigated how allergic asthma impacts the maternal environment and inflammatory markers in the placenta and fetal brain during gestation. Female C57Bl/6 mice were primed with ovalbumin (OVA) prior to allergic asthma induction during pregnancy by administering aerosolized ovalbumin or PBS control to pregnant dams at gestational days (GD)9.5, 12.5, and 17.5. Four hours after the final induction, placenta and fetal brains were collected and measured for changes in cytokines using a Luminex bead-based multiplex assay. Placental MAA tissue showed a decrease in interleukin (IL)-17 in male and female offspring. There was a sex-dependent decrease in female monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). In male placentas, IL-4, C&amp;amp;ndash;X&amp;amp;ndash;C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10)&amp;amp;mdash;also known as interferon &amp;amp;gamma;-induced protein 10 kDa (IP-10)&amp;amp;mdash;and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (RANTES) were decreased. In fetal brains, elevated inflammatory cytokines were found in MAA offspring when compared to controls. Specifically, interferon-gamma (IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 1&amp;amp;alpha; (IL-1&amp;amp;alpha;), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor &amp;amp;alpha; (TNF&amp;amp;alpha;) were elevated in both males and females. In contrast, a decrease in the cytokine IL-9 was also observed. There were slight sex differences after OVA exposures. Male fetal brains showed elevated levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), whereas female brains showed increased keratinocytes-derived chemokine (KC). In addition, IL-1&amp;amp;#120573; and IP-10 in male fetal brains were decreased. Together, these data indicate that repeated exposure to allergic asthma during pregnancy alters cytokine expression in the fetal environment in a sex-dependent way, resulting in homeostatic and neuroinflammatory alterations in the fetal brain.</p>

	<p>Ataxia is a constellation of symptoms that involves a lack of coordination, imbalance, and difficulty walking. Hereditary ataxia occurs when a person is born with defective genes, and this degenerative disorder may progress for several years. There is no effective cure for ataxia, so we need to search for new treatments. Recently, interest in riluzole in the treatment of ataxia has emerged. We conducted this systematic review to analyze the safety and efficacy of riluzole for treating hereditary ataxia in recent clinical trials. We conducted a systematic review using PubMed and Google Scholar as databases in search of this relationship. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocols to conduct this study. For inclusion criteria, we included full-text clinical trials on humans written in English and found three clinical trials. We excluded case reports, literature reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses for this analysis. We aimed to evaluate the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score, and the safety of the medication. Two out of the three clinical trials showed statistically significant clinical improvement in the ICARS and SARA scores, while the other trial did not show improvement in the clinical or radiological outcomes. The drug was safe in all clinical trials. Overall, the results of this analysis of riluzole for the treatment of hereditary ataxia are encouraging. Further clinical trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of riluzole on hereditary ataxia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Development of Eight Wireless Automated Cages System with Two Lickometers Each for Rodents</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Drinking behavior has been used in fundamental research to study metabolism, motivation, decision-making and different aspects of health problems, such as anhedonia and alcohol use disorders. In the majority of studies, liquid intake is measured by weighing the bottles before and after the experiment. This method does not tell much about the drinking microstructure, e.g., licking bouts and periods of preference for each liquid, which could be valuable to understand drinking behavior. To improve data acquisition of drinking microstructure, companies have developed lickometer devices that acquire timestamps when animals approach or drink from a specific sipper. Nevertheless, commercially available devices have elevated costs. Here, we present a low-cost alternative for a lickometer system that allows wireless data acquisition of licks from eight cages with two sippers each. We ran a three-phase validation protocol to ensure (1) proper choice of the sensor to detect licks; (2) adaptation of the device to a wireless transmission and realistic <I>in silico</I> tests; and (3) <I>in vivo</I> validation to test the correlation between the amount of licks measured by the lickometer and the bottle weight. The capacitive sensor presented appropriate recall and precision for our device. After adaptation to wireless transmission, the <I>in silico</I> validation demonstrated low reading and transmission errors even when tested in extreme simultaneous licking conditions. Finally, we observed a positive correlation between water or ethanol consumption and lick count, showing that the lickometers can be used for <I>in vivo</I> studies interested in rodent drinking microstructure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Patient perspectives on home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after total hip arthroplasty: A qualitative study (PHETHAS-2) [version 4; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Home-based rehabilitation exercise following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) shows similar outcomes compared to supervised outpatient rehabilitation exercise. Little is known about patients' experiences with home-based rehabilitation, and this study aimed to investigate how patients perceived home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA, focusing on facilitators and barriers. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of qualitative design were conducted with 22 patients who had undergone THA and who had performed home-based rehabilitation exercise. The study took place in a regional hospital in Denmark between January 2018 and May 2019. Data were analyzed using an interpretive thematic analysis approach, with theoretical underpinning from the concept ‘conduct of everyday life’. The study is embedded within the Pragmatic Home-Based Exercise Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty-Silkeborg trial (PHETHAS-1). Results: The main theme, ‘wishing to return to the well-known everyday life’, and four subthemes were identified. Generally, participants found the home-based rehabilitation exercise boring but were motivated by the goal of returning to their well-known everyday life and performing their usual general physical activities, though some lacked contact to physiotherapist. Participants enrolled in the PHETHAS-1 study used the enrollment as part of their motivation for doing the exercises.  Both pain and the absence of pain were identified as barriers for doing home-based rehabilitation exercise. Pain could cause insecurity about possible medical complications, while the absence of pain could lead to the rehabilitation exercise being perceived as pointless. Conclusions: The overall goal of returning to the well-known everyday life served as a facilitator for undertaking home-based rehabilitation exercise after THA along with the flexibility regarding time and place for performing exercises. Boring exercises as well as both pain and no pain were identified as barriers to the performance of home-based rehabilitation exercise. Participants were motivated towards performing general physical activities which were part of their everyday life.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Next-generation sequencing (NGS) reveals low-abundance HIV-1 drug resistance mutations among patients experiencing virological failure at the time of therapy switching in Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The emergence and spread of antiretroviral drug resistant HIV-1 variants is one of the major factors associated with therapeutic failure in persons living with HIV (PLWH) as it jeopardizes the efforts to reduce the progression to AIDS. Whereas Sanger sequencing is the most appropriate conventional method for HIV drug resistance testing, it has limited capacity to detect low-abundance variants. This study assessed the suitability of next generation sequencing (NGS) to reveal low-abundance HIV-1 drug resistance mutations amongst patients experiencing virological failure at the time of therapy switching in Uganda. Methods: Archived blood samples previously collected from 60 PLWH were used in this study. Briefly HIV viral RNA was extracted and performed targeted NGS of portions of both the HIV protease and reverse transcriptase genes on the illumina MiSeq. For performance comparison, Sanger sequencing was also performed for all the samples targeting the highlighted genes. The sequence data generated was analyzed using HyDRA bioinformatics pipeline, accompanied by the Stanford HIV drug resistance database, to annotate and report drug resistance mutations/variants. Results: Out of the 60 samples, 58 passed preliminary quality control and were considered for subsequent analysis—of which 38/58 (65.5%) registered low-abundance HIV drug resistance variants. Overall, 757 variants from the NGS data and 90 variants from the Sanger data were identified. The most prevalent minority variants included; K65R (65.5%), K14R (63.8%), K45R (63.8%), L63P (63.8%), I15V (63.8%), K70R (60.3%), V77I (60.3%), L283I (60.3%), G16E (58.6%) and L282C (58.6%). Conclusion: An estimated 65.5% of the sampled population harbors low-abundance HIV-1 variants, most of which are associated with virological failure, and consequently antiviral drug resistance. NGS suitably detects drug resistance mutations even at frequencies below 20% of the viral quasi species that are occasionally missed by Sanger sequencing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Changing the method of consent to increase the numbers of cadaveric donors in Saudi Arabia: the autonomy paradox [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Saudi Arabia, the gap between the demand and availability of organs persists, with a total of 13,731 patients who remain on the waiting list in 2019. Family refusal is a major obstacle limiting donation since their consent must be obtained prior to the retrieval of organs. The cause of family refusal is mainly due to the unknown wishes of their loved one to become a donor. This analysis aimed to compare three systems of obtaining consent in terms of effectiveness, respect for personal autonomy, and the cultural role of families in Saudi Arabia to ensure feasibility and effectiveness in increasing the number of donors. Policy alternatives and implications: The consent systems include opt-in (explicit consent), opt-out (presumed consent), and mandated choice systems. The mandated choice policy might be the optimal solution to investigate since it could balance the respect for individual autonomy and the cultural role of families in Saudi Arabia. Conclusions and recommendations: Mandated choice ensures the respect of personal autonomy while influencing the next of kin's decision to donate the organs. Additionally, a recommendation to decision makers is to utilize the Tawakkalna app to send alerts to the next of kin when a user registers as a donor with the user's consent. Moreover, more research should be dedicated to investigating the Saudi public's current culture and perceptions of organ donation to ensure feasibility.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational approach to modeling microbiome landscapes associated with chronic human disease progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lu Li, Jiho Sohn, Robert J. Genco, Jean Wactawski-Wende, Steve Goodison, Patricia I. Diaz, Yijun Sun</p>

A microbial community is a dynamic system undergoing constant change in response to internal and external stimuli. These changes can have significant implications for human health. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining longitudinal samples, the study of the dynamic relationship between the microbiome and human health remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a novel computational strategy that uses massive cross-sectional sample data to model microbiome landscapes associated with chronic disease development. The strategy is based on the rationale that each static sample provides a snapshot of the disease process, and if the number of samples is sufficiently large, the footprints of individual samples populate progression trajectories, which enables us to recover disease progression paths along a microbiome landscape by using computational approaches. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline and applied it to a gut microbiome dataset available from a Crohn’s disease study. Our analysis resulted in one of the first working models of microbial progression for Crohn’s disease. We performed a series of interrogations to validate the constructed model. Our analysis suggested that the model recapitulated the longitudinal progression of microbial dysbiosis during the known clinical trajectory of Crohn’s disease. By overcoming restrictions associated with complex longitudinal sampling, the proposed strategy can provide valuable insights into the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of chronic disease and facilitate the shift of the field from descriptive research to mechanistic studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The pursuit of happiness: A reinforcement learning perspective on habituation and comparisons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rachit Dubey, Thomas L. Griffiths, Peter Dayan</p>

In evaluating our choices, we often suffer from two tragic relativities. First, when our lives change for the better, we rapidly habituate to the higher standard of living. Second, we cannot escape comparing ourselves to various relative standards. Habituation and comparisons can be very disruptive to decision-making and happiness, and till date, it remains a puzzle why they have come to be a part of cognition in the first place. Here, we present computational evidence that suggests that these features might play an important role in promoting adaptive behavior. Using the framework of reinforcement learning, we explore the benefit of employing a reward function that, in addition to the reward provided by the underlying task, also depends on prior expectations and relative comparisons. We find that while agents equipped with this reward function are less happy, they learn faster and significantly outperform standard reward-based agents in a wide range of environments. Specifically, we find that relative comparisons speed up learning by providing an exploration incentive to the agents, and prior expectations serve as a useful aid to comparisons, especially in sparsely-rewarded and non-stationary environments. Our simulations also reveal potential drawbacks of this reward function and show that agents perform sub-optimally when comparisons are left unchecked and when there are too many similar options. Together, our results help explain why we are prone to becoming trapped in a cycle of never-ending wants and desires, and may shed light on psychopathologies such as depression, materialism, and overconsumption.

                <p>by Athira Athira, Daniel Dondorp, Jerneja Rudolf, Olivia Peytral, Marios Chatzigeorgiou</p>

Vertebrate nervous systems can generate a remarkable diversity of behaviors. However, our understanding of how behaviors may have evolved in the chordate lineage is limited by the lack of neuroethological studies leveraging our closest invertebrate relatives. Here, we combine high-throughput video acquisition with pharmacological perturbations of bioamine signaling to systematically reveal the global structure of the motor behavioral repertoire in the <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> larvae. Most of <i>Ciona</i>’s postural variance can be captured by 6 basic shapes, which we term “eigencionas.” Motif analysis of postural time series revealed numerous stereotyped behavioral maneuvers including “startle-like” and “beat-and-glide.” Employing computational modeling of swimming dynamics and spatiotemporal embedding of postural features revealed that behavioral differences are generated at the levels of motor modules and the transitions between, which may in part be modulated by bioamines. Finally, we show that flexible motor module usage gives rise to diverse behaviors in response to different light stimuli.

Cycling of organic carbon in the ocean has the potential to mitigate or exacerbate global climate change, but major questions remain about the environmental controls on organic carbon flux in the coastal zone. Here, we used a field experiment distributed across 28° of latitude, and the entire range of 2 dominant kelp species in the northern hemisphere, to measure decomposition rates of kelp detritus on the seafloor in relation to local environmental factors. Detritus decomposition in both species were strongly related to ocean temperature and initial carbon content, with higher rates of biomass loss at lower latitudes with warmer temperatures. Our experiment showed slow overall decomposition and turnover of kelp detritus and modeling of coastal residence times at our study sites revealed that a significant portion of this production can remain intact long enough to reach deep marine sinks. The results suggest that decomposition of these kelp species could accelerate with ocean warming and that low-latitude kelp forests could experience the greatest increase in remineralization with a 9% to 42% reduced potential for transport to long-term ocean sinks under short-term (RCP4.5) and long-term (RCP8.5) warming scenarios. However, slow decomposition at high latitudes, where kelp abundance is predicted to expand, indicates potential for increasing kelp-carbon sinks in cooler (northern) regions. Our findings reveal an important latitudinal gradient in coastal ecosystem function that provides an improved capacity to predict the implications of ocean warming on carbon cycling. Broad-scale patterns in organic carbon decomposition revealed here can be used to identify hotspots of carbon sequestration potential and resolve relationships between carbon cycling processes and ocean climate at a global scale.

                Primary forests—old-growth forests that have remained undisturbed by humankind—comprise one-third of the world’s forests. These dense, wild forests are important habitats for unique species (1) and provide a variety of ecosystem services, including global biosphere-atmosphere CO2 exchange (2). Such forests are irreplaceable in terms of biodiversity value and ecosystem services, and replantation to compensate for such forest loss is inadequate (3). Yet loss of primary forests continues all over the world, and governments have failed to protect them (4). For example, in India, primary forest is being lost in biodiversity hotspots, which should be environmental priorities. India’s government must acknowledge the value of primary forests and prioritize their conservation by committing to holistic conservation strategies.

                The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) population currently spans the mountainous regions of 12 countries, including more than 80,000 square kilometers in northern Pakistan (1). As a result of human encroachment and hunting, snow leopards are classified as Vulnerable (2). Climate change is exacerbating the threats the snow leopard already faces as well as transforming their environment in ways that make survival more difficult. Pakistan must take urgent action to protect this important species.

                Background: Academic success of international medical students enrolled in Chinese universities is of great significance, because it directly influences their performance in the license exam and in obtaining a job. Insufficient research has been conducted on academics’ awareness of factors related to teaching that affect their students’ academic success.  Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with academics (N=36) from November 2020 to January 2021 at two medical universities in China. Each interview, lasting between 30 to 70-min, was audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.  Results: The important teaching factors that academics perceived to influence the success of students are: (i) style of pedagogy, (ii) addressing students’ language difficulties and differences, (iii) teaching resources management, (iv) attributes of the academics, (v) supervision and guidance by the academics, (vi) rapport between the academic and student, (vii) linking teaching content to license exams, (viii) classroom discipline management, and (ix) assessment style. Conclusions: University faculties and departments that are involved in teaching international medical students need to ensure that academic staff are provided with ongoing professional development and resources to enhance teaching quality. The nine areas identified above should provide priority topics for such staff training.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Adverse COVID-19 vaccination effects in Finnish patients with Ménière’s disease: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The association between reporting adverse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination effects and those with a history of audiovestibular difficulties is unknown. The aim of this research is therefore to investigate adverse vaccination effects in adults with a history of Ménière’s disease. Specifically, the incidence of adverse effects, the factors associated with those reporting adverse effects and the relationship between the reporting of audiovestibular and other adverse effects. Methods: A mixed-methods exploratory cross-sectional survey study design was used. Data were collected from 333 members of the Finnish Ménière Association. The survey was designed to obtain demographic information that may be associated with having adverse effects or not, vaccination-specific information and adverse vaccination effects. Both health and audiovestibular adverse events were identified. Data analysis included comparing those reporting and not reporting adverse vaccination effects. Results: The mean age was 63 years with 81% being female. Of the 327 respondents who had one of the COVID-19 vaccinations (Comirnatry/ Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, or Moderna), 203 (62%) reported no adverse effects. The type of or number of vaccinations were not related to the reporting of adverse effects. The most frequently reported adverse effects were injection site tenderness (38%), arm pain (21%), fever (15%) and headaches (15%). Post-vaccination tinnitus and vertigo (both 7%) were the most frequently reported audiovestibular-related symptoms, followed by aural fullness (6%) and hearing loss (4%). Those reporting previous pre-vaccination vertigo were more likely to have post-vaccination vertigo. The presence of post-vaccination tinnitus, hearing loss, and aural fullness, predicted the presence of post-vaccination vertigo. Conclusions: A small proportion of patients with a history of Ménière’s disease may experience adverse post-vaccination effects. Further research is required to explore whether adverse post-vaccination audiovestibular effects are more prevalent in those with a history of otological disorders compared with the general population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of ingestion of red dragon fruit extract on levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase after strenuous exercise in rats (Rattus norvegicus) [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prolonged activation of skeletal muscles causes a decrease in the production of fatigue. Exercise with strenuous intensity causes an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). An increase in free radicals causes oxidative stress resulting in damage to cell function to mitochondrial dysfunction, and fatigue. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant potential of red dragon fruit (RDF) to delay fatigue due to oxidative stress, which improves cell function in mitochondria. Methods: 25 male rats (Rattus norvegicus) aged three months were divided into five groups: Group K1 was N.A. (No Activity) but drinking and eating; Group K2 performed strenuous exercise without RDF treatment; Groups 3, 4, and 5 (P1, P2 and P3, respectively) performed strenuous exercise and were treated with 75 mg kg-1.bw, 150 mg kg-1.bw, and 300 mg kg-1.bw of RDF extract, respectively. The exercise for the rats involved intense swimming for 20 minutes  a day three time a week for fouweeks.  Malondialdehyde (MDA) dan SOD was measured with the ELISA and histopathology for muscle soleus and lung tissue. Results: Strenuous exercise followed by RDF extract ingestion was compared for fatigue in terms of duration and time; before (24.55±1.38 minute) and after (95.31±7.82 minute) and led to a significant difference of 39% (p<0.01). The study also compared MDA before and after RDF extract ingestion in the K2 vs. the P1 group (p<0.05). At the same time, P2 differed more significantly (p<0.01). This indicated a spread of free radicals and featured histopathological damage of muscle cells. However, ingestion of RDF extract leads to improvement of soleus muscle cells; thus, repairs cell function, delaying fatigue. Conclusion: This study confirmed that strenuous exercise, which causes an increase in ROS, intensifies free radicals with RDF extract ingestion and declines oxidative stress, repairing cell function and delaying fatigue.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Managing the effect of magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequence on radiomic feature reproducibility in the study of brain metastases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite the promise of radiomics studies, their limited reproducibility has hindered meaningful clinical translation. Variability in study designs as well as image acquisition and processing contribute to unreproducible radiomic results. This work’s purpose was to (i) quantitatively compare variability of radiomic features extracted from 2-D spin echo (SE) and 3-D spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) T1-weighted post-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) images of brain metastases acquired within the same patient in a single imaging session, and (ii) provide a framework to inform data acquisition for reproducible radiomics studies. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 29 patients with pathologically-confirmed brain metastases and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images acquired using 2-D SE and 3-D SPGR sequences within one exam was identified. Metastases were segmented twice by different physicians using semi-automated methods. Radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics for 264 preprocessing variable combinations. Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was computed between features extracted from images acquired by both pulse sequences and different tumor segmentations. Results: We provided general recommendations to improve MR-based radiomic feature reproducibility by clustering and identifying low-concordance features and processing variables. Median CCC between 2-D SE and 3-D SPGR (measuring feature agreement between pulse sequences) was greater for fixed bin count intensity discretization (0.76 versus 0.63) and specific high-concordance features (0.74  versus 0.53). Applying all recommendations improved median CCC from 0.51 to 0.79. Median CCC between contours (measuring feature sensitivity to inter-observer variability) was higher for 2-D SE (0.93 versus 0.86) but improved to 0.93 for 3-D SPGR after low-concordance feature exclusion. Conclusions: The following recommendations are proposed to improve reproducibility: 1) Fixed bin count intensity discretization for all studies, 2) for studies with 2-D and 3-D datasets, excluding high-variability features from downstream analyses, 3) when segmentation is manual or semi-automated, using only 2-D SE images or excluding features susceptible to segmentation variability.

                In this editorial, we identify the key questions requiring further exploration in the sociology of vaccines. In doing so, we discuss the socio-structural forces shaping views towards knowledge about and access to vaccination, trust in vaccines and regulators/decision makers, the associated problem of financial interests in vaccine development and regulation, and global vaccine inequalities. Across the breadth of these issues, we additionally identify a range of theoretical perspectives and conceptual directions that sociologists might utilise when producing innovative empirical, methodological and theoretical research on vaccination relating to risk and uncertainty, conflicts of interest, power and inequality.

                <p>Differences in gut microbiota between Parkinson's disease patients and controls seem to depend on multiple—frequently unmeasured—confounders. Monozygotic twins offer a unique model for controlling several factors responsible for interpersonal variation in gut microbiota. Fecal samples from 20 monozygotic twin pairs (n = 40) discordant for Parkinson's disease were studied (metagenomic shotgun analysis). Paired data analysis detected minimal differences in bacterial taxa abundance at species level (<i>Bacteroides pectinophilus</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.037], <i>Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.050], and <i>Bifidobacterium catenulatum</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.025]) and in predicted metabolic pathways (<i>primary bile acid biosynthesis</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.037]). Additional studies are warranted to understand the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Productivity of mother pigs is lower, and mortality greater, in countries that still confine them in gestation crates [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For decades, pig farmers have used gestation crates to confine pregnant sows. Gestation crates physically restrain sows for most of their life, preventing them from walking or turning around. Growing concern about animal welfare has been pressuring the industry for change, with recent legislation in several countries restricting the use of crates. Still, the notion that gestation crates negatively affect sow welfare has been challenged by producers in regions where crates are still used, who argue that, by facilitating health monitoring and preventing aggression, crates lead to lower sow mortality and higher piglet outputs per sow. We test whether these claims are valid by comparing these parameters across countries with different housing systems. Methods: We use publicly available data from InterPig, a network of pig production economists in 17 countries that provides harmonized methods for meaningful comparisons of production and cost indicators. We focus on the last five years (2015-2019) of data available. Annual sow mortality and the number of pigs sold per sow were compared among (1) countries where gestation crates are the norm (CRATE), (2) countries where gestation crates are restricted to four weeks after insemination (RESTRICTED), and (3) countries where gestation crates are banned (BANNED). Results: Sow mortality was significantly higher (F2,85=5.03;P=0.009), and annual pig production per sow significantly lower (F2,85=5.99;P=0.004), in the CRATE than in the RESTRICTED group. Conclusions: Claims of higher mortality and reduced productivity per sow in crate-free systems are not substantiated by this industry-validated dataset. While many factors differ among the country groups (e.g., genetics, nutrition, climate), the observation that factors other than crating have a greater influence on performance challenges claims of an overall negative effect of loose housing on the parameters investigated. This evidence should be considered in policies affecting the welfare of breeding pigs.

                Background: The Informed Health Choices (IHC) Key Concepts is a framework that provides a basis for developing educational resources and evaluating people’s ability to think critically about health actions. We developed the original Key Concepts framework by reviewing texts and checklists for the public, journalists, and health professionals and collecting structured feedback from an international advisory group. We revised the original 2015 framework yearly from 2016 to 2018 based on feedback and experience using the framework. The objectives of this paper are to describe the development of the framework since 2018 and summarise their basis. Methods: For the 2019 version, we responded to feedback on the 2018 version. For the current 2022 version, in addition to responding to feedback on the 2019 version, we reviewed the evidence base for each of the concepts. Whenever possible, we referenced systematic reviews that provide a basis for a concept. We screened all Cochrane methodology reviews and searched Epistemonikos, PubMed, and Google Scholar for methodology reviews and meta-epidemiological studies. Results: The original framework included 32 concepts in six groups. The 2019 version and the current 2022 version include 49 concepts in the same three main groups that we have used since 2016. There are now 10 subgroups or higher-level concepts. For each concept, there is an explanation including one or more examples, the basis for the concept, and implications. Over 600 references are cited that support the concepts, and over half of the references are systematic reviews. Conclusions: There is a large body of evidence that supports the IHC key concepts and we have received few suggestions for changes since 2019.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sapporo: A workflow execution service that encourages the reuse of workflows in various languages in bioinformatics [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The increased demand for efficient computation in data analysis encourages researchers in biomedical science to use workflow systems. Workflow systems, or so-called workflow languages, are used for the description and execution of a set of data analysis steps. Workflow systems increase the productivity of researchers, specifically in fields that use high-throughput DNA sequencing applications, where scalable computation is required. As systems have improved the portability of data analysis workflows, research communities are able to share workflows to reduce the cost of building ordinary analysis procedures. However, having multiple workflow systems in a research field has resulted in the distribution of efforts across different workflow system communities. As each workflow system has its unique characteristics, it is not feasible to learn every single system in order to use publicly shared workflows. Thus, we developed Sapporo, an application to provide a unified layer of workflow execution upon the differences of various workflow systems. Sapporo has two components: an application programming interface (API) that receives the request of a workflow run and a browser-based client for the API. The API follows the Workflow Execution Service API standard proposed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. The current implementation supports the execution of workflows in four languages: Common Workflow Language, Workflow Description Language, Snakemake, and Nextflow. With its extensible and scalable design, Sapporo can support the research community in utilizing valuable resources for data analysis.

                Dopaminergic axons express nicotinic receptors that modulate and evoke neurotransmitter release. Using direct recordings from dopaminergic axons, Kramer et al. reveal the presence of spontaneous synaptic-like nicotinic axonal EPSPs capable of generating spontaneous axonal action potentials. These findings demonstrate the mechanisms underlying nicotinic-receptor-mediated membrane-potential signaling in dopaminergic axons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modular, cascade-like transcriptional program of regeneration in Stentor</a></h4>

              
                The giant ciliate <i>Stentor coeruleus</i> is a classical model system for studying regeneration and morphogenesis at the level of a single cell. The anterior of the cell is marked by an array of cilia, known as the oral apparatus, which can be induced to shed and regenerate in a series of reproducible morphological steps, previously shown to require transcription. If a cell is cut in half, each half will regenerate an intact cell, including a new oral apparatus in the posterior half. We used RNAseq to assay the dynamic changes in <i>Stentor</i>'s transcriptome during regeneration, after both oral apparatus shedding and bisection, allowing us to identify distinct temporal waves of gene expression including kinases, RNA binding proteins, centriole biogenesis factors, and orthologs of human ciliopathy genes implicated in Meckel and Joubert syndromes. By comparing transcriptional profiles of different regeneration events in the same species, we were able to identify distinct modules of gene expression corresponding to oral apparatus regeneration, posterior holdfast regeneration, and recovery after wounding. By measuring gene expression in cells in which translation is blocked, we show that the sequential waves of gene expression involve a cascade mechanism in which later waves of expression are triggered by translation products of early-expressed genes. Among the early-expressed genes, we identified an E2F transcription factor and the conserved RNA binding protein Pumilio as potential regulators of regeneration based on the expression pattern of their predicted target genes. RNAi mediated knockdown experiments indicate that Pumilio is required for regenerating oral structures of the correct size. We show that E2F is involved in the completion of regeneration but is dispensable for earlier steps. This work allows us to classify regeneration genes into groups based on their potential role for regeneration in distinct cell regeneration paradigms, and provides insight into how a single cell can coordinate complex morphogenetic pathways to regenerate missing structures.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Expansion and contraction of resource allocation in sensory bottlenecks</a></h4>

              
                Topographic sensory representations often do not scale proportionally to the size of their input regions, with some expanded and others contracted. In vision, the foveal representation is magnified cortically, as are the fingertips in touch. What principles drive this allocation, and how should receptor density, e.g. the high innervation of the fovea or the fingertips, and stimulus statistics, e.g. the higher contact frequencies on the fingertips, contribute? Building on work in efficient coding, we address this problem using linear models that optimally decorrelate the sensory signals. We introduce a sensory bottleneck to impose constraints on resource allocation and derive the optimal neural allocation. We find that bottleneck width is a crucial factor in resource allocation, inducing either expansion or contraction. Both receptor density and stimulus statistics affect allocation and jointly determine convergence for wider bottlenecks. Furthermore, we show a close match between the predicted and empirical cortical allocations in a well-studied model system, the star-nosed mole. Overall, our results suggest that the strength of cortical magnification depends on resource limits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coupling to short linear motifs creates versatile PME-1 activities in PP2A holoenzyme demethylation and inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzymes target broad substrates by recognizing short motifs via regulatory subunits. PP2A methylesterase 1 (PME-1) is a cancer-promoting enzyme and undergoes methylesterase activation upon binding to the PP2A core enzyme. Here we showed that PME-1 readily demethylates different families of PP2A holoenzymes and blocks substrate recognition <i>in vitro</i>. The high-resolution cryo-EM structure of a PP2A-B56 holoenzyme-PME-1 complex reveals that PME-1 disordered regions, including a substrate-mimicking motif, tether to the B56 regulatory subunit at remote sites. They occupy the holoenzyme substrate-binding groove and allow large structural shifts in both holoenzyme and PME-1 to enable multi-partite contacts at structured cores to activate the methylesterase. B56-interface mutations selectively block PME-1 activity toward PP2A-B56 holoenzymes and affect the methylation of a fraction of total cellular PP2A. The B56-interface mutations allow us to uncover B56-specific PME-1 functions in p53 signaling. Our studies reveal multiple mechanisms of PME-1 in suppressing holoenzyme functions and versatile PME-1 activities derived from coupling substrate-mimicking motifs to dynamic structured cores.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The evolution of a counter-defense mechanism in a virus constrains its host range</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria use diverse immunity mechanisms to defend themselves against their viral predators, bacteriophages. In turn, phages can acquire counter-defense systems, but it remains unclear how such mechanisms arise and what factors constrain viral evolution. Here, we experimentally evolved T4 phage to overcome a phage-defensive toxin-antitoxin system, <i>toxIN</i>, in <i>E. coli</i>. Through recombination, T4 rapidly acquires segmental amplifications of a previously uncharacterized gene, now named <i>tifA</i>, encoding an inhibitor of the toxin, ToxN. These amplifications subsequently drive large deletions elsewhere in T4's genome to maintain a genome size compatible with capsid packaging. The deleted regions include accessory genes that help T4 overcome defense systems in alternative hosts. Thus, our results reveal a trade-off in viral evolution; the emergence of one counter-defense mechanism can lead to loss of other such mechanisms, thereby constraining host range. We propose that the accessory genomes of viruses reflect the integrated evolutionary history of the hosts they infected.

                Cognitive functions arise from the coordinated activity of neural populations distributed over large-scale brain networks. However, it is challenging to understand and measure how specific aspects of neural dynamics translate into operations of information processing, and, ultimately, cognitive functions. An obstacle is that simple circuit mechanisms such as self-sustained or propagating activity and nonlinear summation of inputs do not directly give rise to high-level functions. Nevertheless, they already implement simple transformations of the information carried by neural activity. Here, we propose that distinct neural circuit functions, such as stimulus representation, working memory, or selective attention stem from different combinations and types of low-level manipulations of information, or information processing primitives. To test this hypothesis, we combine approaches from information theory with computational simulations of canonical neural circuits involving one or more interacting brain regions that emulate well-defined cognitive functions. More specifically, we track the dynamics of information emergent from dynamic patterns of neural activity, using suitable quantitative metrics to detect where and when information is actively buffered (active information storage), transferred (information transfer) or non-linearly merged (information modification), as possible modes of low-level processing. We find that neuronal subsets maintaining representations in working memory or performing attention-related gain modulation are signaled by their boosted involvement in operations of active information storage or information modification, respectively. Thus, information dynamics metrics, beyond detecting which network units participate in cognitive processing, also promise to specify how and when they do it, i.e., through which type of primitive computation, a capability that may be exploited for the parsing of actual experimental recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor gates plasticity in developing visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                We have previously shown that recovery of visual responses to a deprived eye during the critical period in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) requires both export of mRNA encoding brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to the dendrites of cortical cells (Kaneko et al., 2012) and phosphorylation of the TrkB receptor for BDNF (Kaneko et al., 2008a). TrkB phosphorylation is not required for the loss of response during monocular deprivation (MD). Studies in vitro show that formation of new connections requires BDNF (Meyer-Franke et al., 1995, 1998; Gottmann et al., 2009). We have now studied the temporal relationship between the production of mature BDNF and the recovery of visual responses. Visual cortical responses to an eye whose vision has been occluded for several days during the critical period and is then re-opened recovers rapidly during binocular vision or more slowly following reverse occlusion, when the previously intact fellow eye is occluded in a model of patch therapy for amblyopia. The time to recovery of visual responses differed by 18 hours between these two procedures, but in each the production of mature BDNF preceded the recovery by 6 hours. These findings suggest that a spurt of BDNF secretion stimulates the growth of connections serving the deprived eye to restore visual responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory corticostriatal connections in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Auditory learning critically depends on sensory, decisional, and reward-based processes that are supported by the dorsal striatum. Auditory corticostriatal connections have been well-characterized in animal models including non-human primates, where primary auditory cortex preferentially connects to putamen, and caudate head receives most of its inputs from anterior superior temporal cortex. However, the extent to which human auditory corticostriatal connectivity follows similar organizational principles is challenging to assess due the small, deep anatomy of these striatal structures. We leveraged high-quality diffusion-weighted MRI tractography to virtually dissect structural pathways between auditory cortical regions and dorsal striatal regions in a sub-millimeter resolution single-subject dataset. Across most of auditory cortex, putamen connections were more frequent than caudate connections; only anterior-most superior temporal cortex had strong connectivity with caudate, specifically the caudate head. Putamen streamline endpoints were largely along the ventral portion of the structure, ranging from caudal to middle putamen. Consistent with these results, caudate connections were largely confined to an anterior pathway, whereas putamen connections were more equally spread between anterior and posterior pathways to temporal cortex. In contrast to the auditory findings, visual corticostriatal streamlines did not preferentially reach putamen. We replicate these results in an independent sample of near-millimeter resolution single-session diffusion MRI from the Human Connectome Project. Overall, our results suggest strong structural connectivity between primary and association auditory cortices with putamen but not with any subdivision of caudate. Prioritized connectivity between superior temporal cortex and putamen is highly suggestive of distinct functional roles for striatal subdivisions in auditory perception.

                Recent developments on Bayesian inference and prediction for effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) stem from a wide variety of methods, including machine learning, multilevel models, and others. However, few of these approaches make use of clear estimates of the ERP voltage across time and across space (scalp). In the present article, via an iterative process, we propose Gaussian random walk (GRW) models that can estimate voltage uncertainty across time and also provide correlation matrices across electrodes. We apply these models to real ERP data from a P3b paradigm as an example. We discuss results in terms of past and current literature of both ERP estimation and electroencephalography analysis in general.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep/wake changes in perturbational complexity in rats and mice</a></h4>

              
                In humans, the level of consciousness can be assessed by quantifying the spatiotemporal complexity of cortical responses using the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) and related PCIst (st, state transitions). These measures are consistently high in wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and low in dreamless non-REM (NREM) sleep, deep slow wave anesthesia, and coma. The neuronal mechanisms underlying the reduction of PCI/PCIst in unconscious states remain largely unexplored. The extent to which different cortical areas or layers contribute to these measures is also unknown. To address these questions, here we first validate the use of PCIst in freely moving rats (8 males) and mice (12, 4 females) by showing that its values are lower in NREM sleep and slow wave anesthesia than in wake or REM sleep, as in humans. We then show that low PCIst is associated with the occurrence of an OFF period of neuronal silence. Moreover, the stimulation of deep, but not superficial, cortical layers leads to reliable changes in PCIst across sleep/wake and anesthesia. Finally, consistent changes in PCIst can be measured independent of which single area is being stimulated or recorded, except for recordings in mouse prefrontal cortex. These experiments directly support the hypothesis that PCIst is low when an OFF period disrupts causal interactions in cortical networks. Moreover, they demonstrate that, as in humans, PCIst can be used for the reliable assessment of vigilance states in unresponsive animals, without the need to rely on behavioral outputs such as the righting reflex.

                The septohippocampal pathway plays an important role in learning and memory. It projects from the medial septum-vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) to the hippocampus and provides the latter with its main cholinergic innervation. To assess the importance of cholinergic selectivity and timing of MSDB stimulation in modulating learning and memory, we directly compared the effects of several MSDB stimulation strategies in healthy rats. We evaluated the effects of DREADD-mediated selective cholinergic neuronal MSDB stimulation and nonselective neuronal MSDB stimulation on spatial learning and memory in the appetitive radial arm maze and on resting-state brain networks using resting-state functional MRI. DREADDs were activated with the novel DREADD agonist J60. Selective cholinergic MSDB stimulation during, but not after, radial arm maze training improved spatial learning compared with J60-treated sham rats and had no effect on working memory or reversal learning. J60-treated sham rats had a worse working memory than saline-treated sham rats during the reversal phase of the radial arm maze task, suggesting an adverse effect of chronic use of J60. Nonselective MSDB stimulation during training resulted in a loss of appetite and exclusion from the radial arm maze training. Acute selective cholinergic and nonselective MSDB stimulation induced decreased functional connectivity (FC) in the default mode-like network. In addition, acute nonselective MSDB stimulation resulted in increased intrahippocampal FC, while selective cholinergic MSDB stimulation led to globally increased FC with the nucleus accumbens. While the combined effect of radial arm maze learning and the necessary chronic food restriction with or without chronic MSDB stimulation had no observable effect on resting-state networks, chronic food restriction alone globally increased FC in the brain.

                Development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is key for enabling communication in individuals who have lost the faculty of speech due to severe motor paralysis. A BCI control strategy that is gaining attention employs speech decoding from neural data. Recent studies have shown that a combination of direct neural recordings and advanced computational models can provide promising results. Understanding which decoding strategies deliver best and directly applicable results is crucial for advancing the field. In this paper, we optimized and validated a decoding approach based on speech reconstruction directly from high-density electrocorticography recordings from sensorimotor cortex during a speech production task. We show that 1) dedicated machine learning optimization of reconstruction models is key for achieving the best reconstruction performance; 2) individual word decoding in reconstructed speech achieves 92-100% accuracy (chance level is 8%); 3) direct reconstruction from sensorimotor brain activity produces intelligible speech. These results underline the need for model optimization in achieving best speech decoding results and highlight the potential that reconstruction-based speech decoding from sensorimotor cortex can offer for development of next-generation BCI technology for communication.

                Currently, there is a need for the generation of non-opioid analgesics for treating chronic pain. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the analgesic effects of testosterone. However, treatment with testosterone is not feasible due to adverse effects. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) were developed to overcome these limitations by minimizing activation of androgenic side effects. First, we demonstrate SARM administration alleviates widespread muscle pain in male and female mice. We then developed a SARM-loaded PLGA microparticle formulation that reverses widespread muscle pain in two injections. In vitro and in vivo release kinetics demonstrate the microparticle formulation had sustained SARM release for 4 weeks. Antagonism of androgen receptors blocked the analgesic effects of the SARM microparticles. SARM treatment had no effect on cardiac or liver enzymes, cardiac histology, and did not produce rewarding behavior. These studies demonstrate SARM microparticles as a potential therapeutic for chronic muscle pain.

                Functional heterogeneity among sensory neurons is a cardinal property of the vertebrate auditory system, yet it is not known how this heterogeneity is established to ensure proper encoding of sound. Here, we show that the transcription factor Runx1 controls the composition of molecularly and physiologically diverse sensory neurons (Ia, Ib, Ic) in the murine cochlea, which collectively encode a wide range of sound intensities. Runx1 is enriched in Ib and Ic spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) precursors by late embryogenesis. Loss of Runx1 from embryonic SGNs (Runx1CKO) shifted the balance of subtype identities without affecting neuron number, with more SGNs taking on Ia identities at the expense of Ib/Ic identities, as shown by single cell RNA-sequencing. This conversion was more complete for genes linked to neuronal function than for those related to connectivity. Accordingly, although synaptic position did not change, synapses in the Ib/Ic location took on Ia-like properties. Suprathreshold responses to sound were enhanced in the auditory nerve of Runx1CKO mice, confirming an expansion of neurons behaving functionally like Ia SGNs. Fate-mapping experiments further showed that deletion of Runx1 shortly after birth also redirected Ib and Ic SGNs towards Ia identity, indicating that SGN subtype identities remain plastic postnatally. Altogether, these findings show that diverse neuronal identities essential for normal auditory stimulus coding arise in a hierarchical fashion that remains malleable during postnatal development.

                Hearing is an essential sense in the life cycle of malaria mosquitoes. Within large swarms formed transiently at dusk, mosquitoes acoustically recognize their mating partners by their wingbeats. Indeed, malaria mosquitoes only respond to the flight tones of mating partners during swarm time. This phenomenon implies a sophisticated context- and time-dependent modulation of mosquito audition, the mechanisms of which are still largely unknown. Using transcriptomics, we identify a complex network of candidate neuromodulators regulating mosquito hearing. Among them, octopamine stands out as regulator of the auditory performance during swarm time. To explore octopamine roles in mosquito hearing, we carried out an in-depth analysis of octopamine-mediated effects on auditory function. We found that octopamine affects the properties of the mosquito ear on multiple levels: it modulates the tuning and stiffness of the flagellar sound receiver and it controls the erection of antennal fibrillae in males. We found that two different receptors are driving octopamine auditory roles, including a novel beta octopamine receptor. We also demonstrate that the octopaminergic auditory control system can be targeted by insecticides. Our findings identify octopamine signalling as a key component of hearing and mating partner detection in malaria mosquitoes, and as a potential novel target for mosquito control.

                Everyday visual experience contains many brief stationary moments when we continue to be consciously aware our sensory input. However, neural activity is dramatically attenuated shortly after the onset response, and it is unclear how the content of our experience remains stable nevertheless. To characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of object representation in sustained viewing conditions, we use intracranial recordings from ten patients viewing images from variable categories in multiple durations. We reveal that the distributed neural representation of categories and exemplars in posterior-sensory regions remains sustained and stable, mirroring the stability of experience, despite substantial variability in activity after the onset response. Additionally, we find transient coding of visual content in frontoparietal cortex, even when no report is required. Together, our results suggest sustained perception is maintained by sensory regions, not by overall activation magnitude but by the position within an "Experience Subspace", and perceptual changes involve frontoparietal regions, regardless of the task. These findings directly inform recent large-scale attempts to test theories of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coordinated cadherin functions sculpt respiratory motor circuit connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Breathing, and the motor circuits that control it, are essential for life. At the core of respiratory circuits are Dbx1-derived interneurons, which generate the rhythm and pattern of breathing, and phrenic motor neurons (MNs), which provide the final motor output that drives diaphragm muscle contractions during inspiration. Despite their critical function, the principles that dictate how respiratory circuits assemble are unknown. Here we show that coordinated activity of a type I cadherin (N-cadherin) and type II cadherins (Cadherin-6, -9, and -10) is required in both MNs and Dbx1-derived neurons to generate robust respiratory motor output. Both MN- and Dbx1-specific cadherin inactivation during a critical developmental window results in perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure and a striking reduction in phrenic MN bursting activity. This combinatorial cadherin code is required to establish phrenic MN cell body and dendritic topography; surprisingly, however, cell body position appears to be dispensable for the targeting of phrenic MNs by descending respiratory inputs. Our findings demonstrate that type I and type II cadherins function cooperatively throughout the respiratory circuit to generate a robust breathing output and reveal novel strategies that drive the assembly of motor circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Role for the Fornix in Temporal Sequence Memory</a></h4>

              
                Converging evidence from studies of human and nonhuman animals suggests that the hippocampus contributes to sequence learning by using temporal context to bind sequentially occurring items. The fornix is a white matter pathway containing the major input and output pathways of the hippocampus, including projections from medial septum, and to diencephalon, striatum, and prefrontal cortex. If the fornix meaningfully contributes to hippocampal function, then individual differences in fornix microstructure might predict sequence memory. Here, we tested this prediction by performing tractography in 51 healthy adults who had undertaken a sequence memory task. Microstructure properties of the fornix were compared with those of tracts connecting medial temporal lobe regions, but not predominantly the hippocampus: the Parahippocampal Cingulum bundle (PHC) (conveying retrosplenial projections to parahippocampal cortex) and the Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus (ILF) (conveying occipital projections to perirhinal cortex). Using principal components analysis, we combined Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging measures obtained from multi-shell diffusion MRI into two informative indices, the first (PC1) capturing axonal packing/myelin, the second (PC2) capturing microstructural complexity. We found a significant correlation between fornix PC2 and implicit reaction-time indices of sequence memory, indicating that greater fornix microstructural complexity is associated with better sequence memory. No such relationship was found with measures from the PHC and ILF. This study highlights the importance of the fornix in aiding memory for objects within a temporal context, potentially reflecting a role in mediating network communication within an extended hippocampal system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Soluble amyloid-β precursor peptide does not regulate GABAB receptor activity</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid-{beta} precursor protein (APP) regulates neuronal activity through the release of secreted APP (sAPP) acting at cell-surface receptors. APP and sAPP were reported to bind to the extracellular sushi domain 1 (SD1) of GABAB receptors (GBRs). A 17 amino-acid peptide (APP17) derived from APP was sufficient for SD1 binding and shown to mimic the inhibitory effect of sAPP on neurotransmitter release and neuronal activity. The functional effects of APP17 and sAPP were similar to those of the GBR agonist baclofen and blocked by a GBR antagonist. These experiments led to the proposal that sAPP activates GBRs to exert its neuronal effects. However, whether APP17 and sAPP indeed influence classical GBR signaling pathways in heterologous cells was not analyzed. Here, we confirm that APP17 binds to GBRs with nanomolar affinity. However, biochemical and electrophysiological assays indicate that APP17 does not influence GBR activity in heterologous cells. Moreover, we found no evidence for APP17 regulating K+ currents in cultured neurons, neurotransmitter release in brain slices, or neuronal activity in vivo. Our results show that APP17 is not a functional GBR ligand and indicate that sAPP exerts neuronal effects through receptors other than GBRs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multifunctional requirements for ERK1/2 signaling in the development of ganglionic eminence derived glia and cortical inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 intracellular signaling pathway is activated by numerous cues during brain development and dysregulated in neurodevelopmental syndromes, particularly the RASopathies and certain forms of autism. Cortical excitatory/inhibitory imbalance is thought to be critical in the neuropathogenesis of these conditions. However, the developmental functions of ERK1/2 signaling in cortical inhibitory neurons (CINs) and other medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived non-neuronal cells are poorly understood. Here, we genetically modulated ERK1/2 signaling in mouse MGE neural progenitors or GABAergic neurons in vivo. We find that MEK-ERK1/2 signaling is essential for regulating MGE-derived oligodendrocyte number in the anterior commissure. While Erk1/2 inactivation does not alter CIN number, we show that CIN-autonomous ERK1/2 signaling is necessary for chemogenetic activity-dependent FOSB expression in vivo. This deficit coincides with a significant and persistent reduction in somatostatin, but not parvalbumin, expression in a subset of ERK1/2 deleted inhibitory neurons. Interestingly, one week of chronic chemogenetic stimulation in juvenile or adult animals partially rescues the decrease in somatostatin expression in Erk1/2 mutant CINs. Our data demonstrate ERK1/2 signaling is required for the establishment of MGE-derived glia, whereas in CINs, ERK1/2 drives activity dependent-responses and the expression of somatostatin in a subset of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A circuit mechanism for the coordinated actions of opposing neuropeptide and neurotransmitter signals</a></h4>

              
                Fast-acting neurotransmitters and slow, modulatory neuropeptides are commonly co-released from neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), albeit from distinct synaptic vesicles. The mechanisms of how co-released neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that have opposing actions, e.g., stimulatory versus inhibitory, work together to exert control of neural circuit output remain unclear. This question has been difficult to resolve due to the inability to selectively isolate these signaling pathways in a cell- and circuit-specific manner. To overcome these barriers, we developed a genetic-based anatomical disconnect procedure that utilizes distinct DNA recombinases to independently facilitate conditional in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of neurotransmitter- and neuropeptide-related genes in distinct cell types in two different brain regions simultaneously. With this approach we demonstrate that the stimulatory neuropeptide neurotensin (Nts) and the inhibitory neurotransmitter {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are co-released from neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), work coordinately to activate dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA-DA). We show that GABA release from LH-Nts neurons acts on GABA neurons within the VTA to rapidly disinhibit VTA-DA neurons, while Nts signals through the Nts receptor 1 (Ntsr1) on VTA-DA neurons to promote a slow depolarization of these cells. Thus, these two signals act on distinct time scales through different cell types to enhance mesolimbic dopamine neuron activation, which optimizes behavioral reinforcement. These data demonstrate a circuit-based mechanism for the coordinated action of a neurotransmitter and neuropeptide with opposing effects on cell physiology.

	<p>Executive function task (EF) deficits are hypothesized to underlie difficulties with self-regulation. However, tasks assessing EF impairments have only been weakly correlated with rating scales that index self-regulation difficulties. A community sample of children and youth aged between 8 and 20 years old were assessed longitudinally. Growth curve analyses and correlations were conducted to better understand how these two types of measures relate to one another across development, as well as the impact of age-related variance. EF was assessed using the Stroop Task and Trail Making test and behavioral ratings of self-regulation were captured using the SWAN scale. EF task performance improved steeply until age 14&amp;amp;ndash;15, whereas the SWAN Scale showed small age-related decreases. EF task performance was moderately correlated with age among 8&amp;amp;ndash;13-year-olds and to a lesser extent among 14&amp;amp;ndash;20-year-olds. SWAN scores were not significantly related to age in either group. Correlations were similar in an ADHD &amp;amp;ldquo;at-risk&amp;amp;rdquo; subgroup. EF task performance and parent ratings of attention regulation have different developmental trajectories, which may partly explain why correlations are low to modest in these samples. In particular, age-related variance is an important methodological consideration with significant implications for the assessment of self-regulation in children and youth with ADHD.</p>

	<p>The high prevalence of diagnosed cases of severe neurological disorders, a significant proportion of which are epilepsy, contributes to a high level of mortality and disability in the population. Neurotrophic factors BDNF and GNDF are considered promising agents aimed at increasing the central nervous system&amp;amp;rsquo;s adaptive potential for the development of the epileptiform activity. Despite the pronounced neuroprotective and anticonvulsant potential, an appropriate way to stimulate these endogenous signaling molecules with minimal risk of side effects remains an open question. Herein, we assessed the safety of gene therapy using original adeno-associated viral constructs carrying the genes of neurotrophic factors BDNF and GDNF in the early postnatal period of development of experimental animals. The intraventricular injection of AAV-Syn-BDNF-eGFP and AAV-Syn-GDNF-eGFP viral constructs into newborn mice was found to provide persistent overexpression of target genes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in vivo for four weeks after injection. The application of viral constructs has a multidirectional effect on the weight and body length characteristics of mice in the early postnatal period; however, it ensures the animals&amp;amp;rsquo; resistance to the development of seizure activity under audiogenic stimulation in the late postnatal period and preserves basic behavioral reactions, emotional status, as well as the mnestic and cognitive abilities of mice after simulated stress. Our results demonstrated the safety of using the AAV-Syn-BDNF-eGFP and AAV-Syn-GDNF-eGFP viral constructs in vivo, which indicates the expediency of further testing the constructs as therapeutic anticonvulsants.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to determine how transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) alters autonomic nervous activity by comparing the effects of different tVNS frequencies and current intensities. We also investigated the sex-dependent autonomic response to tVNS. Thirty-five healthy adult participants were stimulated using a tVNS stimulator at the left cymba conchae while sitting on a reclining chair; tVNS-induced waveform changes were then recorded for different stimulus frequencies (Experiment 1: 3.0 mA at 100 Hz, 25 Hz, 10 Hz, 1 Hz, and 0 Hz (no stimulation)) and current intensities (Experiment 2: 100 Hz at 3.0 mA, 1.0 mA, 0.2 mA (below sensory threshold), and 0 mA (no stimulation)) using an electrocardiogram. Pulse widths were set at 250 &amp;amp;micro;s in both experiment 1 and 2. Changes in heart rate (HR), root-mean-square of the difference between two successive R waves (RMSSD), and the ratio between low-frequency (LF) (0.04&amp;amp;ndash;0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF) (0.15&amp;amp;ndash;0.40 Hz) bands (LF/HF) in spectral analysis, which indicates sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, respectively, in heart rate variability (HRV), were recorded for analysis. Although stimulation at all frequencies significantly reduced HR (p = 0.001), stimulation at 100 Hz had the most pronounced effect (p = 0.001) in Experiment 1 and was revealed to be required to deliver at 3.0 mA in Experiment 2 (p = 0.003). Additionally, participants with higher baseline sympathetic activity experienced higher parasympathetic response during stimulation, and sex differences may exist in the autonomic responses by the application of tVNS. Therefore, our findings suggest that optimal autonomic changes induced by tVNS to the left cymba conchae vary depending on stimulating parameters and sex.</p>

	<p>The objective of the study is to provide age-related normative values for dorsal sural nerve (DSN) and to analyse its application during follow-up of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) pre-symptomatic subjects. We consecutively recruited ATTRv pre-symptomatic carriers in which clinical examination, cardiological evaluation, and nerve conduction studies of the sural nerve and DSN were performed. To provide normative data of DSN, neurophysiologic parameters from healthy controls referred to our service were entered into linear regression analyses to check the relative influence of age and height. A correction grid was then derived. We collected 231 healthy subjects: the mean DSN sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude was 9.99 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.48 &amp;amp;mu;V; the mean conduction velocity was 49.01 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.31 m/s. Significant correlations were found between age and height with DSN SNAP amplitude. Fifteen ATTRv pre-symptomatic carriers were examined. Sural nerve NCS were normal in 12/15 and revealed low/borderline values in three subjects. Considering our correction grid, we found an abnormal DNS amplitude in 9/15 subjects and low/borderline values in 2/15. In ATTRv, early detection of peripheral nerve damage is crucial to start a disease-modifying treatment. DSN may be easily and reliably included in the routine neurophysiological follow-up of ATTRv pre-symptomatic subjects.</p>

	<p>Cognitive load significantly influences learning effectiveness. All the three types of cognitive load&amp;amp;mdash;intrinsic, extraneous, and germane&amp;amp;mdash;are important for guiding teachers in preparing effective instructional designs for students. However, the techniques used to assess the relationship between brain activity and cognitive load during learning activities require further investigation. This study preliminarily examined cognitive load during mathematics computations based on cognitive-load theory. We used event-related potentials to compare carryover and without carryover additions under three types of stimuli (uncoloured Arabic numerals, colourful Arabic numerals, and Chinese numerals) to measure learners&amp;amp;rsquo; cognitive load. According to the concept and rationale of cognitive-load theory, the design defined the extraneous and germane cognitive load to measure the N1 and P2 components and the relevant behavioural data. The highest P2 amplitude was observed in the Chinese numerals condition as extraneous cognitive load, and the N1 component was observed in the colourful Arabic numerals condition as germane cognitive load. Thus, both components may play an important role in extraneous and germane cognitive load. Additionally, these exhibit negative correlations during mathematical computations. This study&amp;amp;rsquo;s findings and implications offer insights into future ways for assessing cognitive load using brain imaging techniques and potential applications for brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces.</p>

	<p>This study was carried out on six adult red kangaroos of both sexes. To determine the location of the oligodendrocytes (OLGs) of the hippocampus (Hip) and corpus callosum (CC), the method of impregnation of the neuroglia with silver salts was applied. The iron distribution in the OLGs was determined by the histochemical method. The Nissl method was used to determine the location of the brain structure and to analyze the number of OLGs. In the Hip, these cells are located one beside another, mainly in blood vessels and neurons; in the neocortex (NC), they are located in layers I&amp;amp;ndash;VI; and in the CC, they are arranged in characteristic rows and accompany both nerve fibers and blood vessels. The analysis of the results obtained by the chosen methods in the Hip, NC, and CC in males and females did not show statistically significant differences in the distribution and location of the red kangaroo OLGs. The involvement of these cells is a physiological process that proceeds in a similar manner throughout the life of individuals and actively influences the metabolism of neurons and myelin.</p>

	<p>The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and systemic immune-inflammatory (SII) index, which provide a simple, rapid, inexpensive method to measure the level of inflammation, have been examined as potential inflammatory biomarkers of bipolar disorder (BD) in several studies. We conducted a case-control study recruiting 180 BD patients and 407 healthy controls. BD patients who met the inclusion criteria and were hospitalized due to BD at the psychiatry clinic of the University General Hospital of Larisa, Greece, until September 2021 were included in the study. Among them, 111 patients experienced a manic episode and 69 patients experienced a depressive episode. Data including a complete blood count were retrieved from their first admission to the hospital. Bipolar patients had a higher NLR, MLR and SII index compared to healthy controls when they were experiencing a manic episode (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and a depressive episode (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). MLR was increased with large effect size only in patients expressing manic episodes. Neutrophils and NLR had the highest area under the curve with a cutoff of 4.38 and 2.15 in the ROC curve, respectively. Gender-related differences were mainly observed in the SII index, with males who were expressing manic episodes and females expressing depressive episodes having an increased index compared to healthy controls. The NLR, MLR and SII index were significantly higher in patients with BD than in healthy controls, which implies a higher grade of inflammation in BD patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Questionable Research Practices, Low Statistical Power, and Other Obstacles to Replicability: Why Preclinical Neuroscience Research Would Benefit from Registered Reports</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Replicability, the degree to which a previous scientific finding can be repeated in a distinct set of data, has been considered an integral component of institutionalized scientific practice since its inception several hundred years ago. In the past decade, large-scale replication studies have demonstrated that replicability is far from favorable, across multiple scientific fields. Here, I evaluate this literature and describe contributing factors including the prevalence of questionable research practices (QRPs), misunderstanding of <I>p</I>-values, and low statistical power. I subsequently discuss how these issues manifest specifically in preclinical neuroscience research. I conclude that these problems are multifaceted and difficult to solve, relying on the actions of early and late career researchers, funding sources, academic publishers, and others. I assert that any viable solution to the problem of substandard replicability must include changing academic incentives, with adoption of registered reports being the most immediately impactful and pragmatic strategy. For animal research in particular, comprehensive reporting guidelines that document potential sources of sensitivity for experimental outcomes is an essential addition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Ablation of Sod2 in Astrocytes Induces Sex-Specific Effects on Cognitive Function, D-Serine Availability, and Astrogliosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive decline is a debilitating aspect of aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species, neuroinflammation, and astrogliosis. This study investigated the effects of decreased mitochondrial antioxidant response specifically in astrocytes on cognitive performance and neuronal function in C57BL/6J mice using a tamoxifen-inducible astrocyte-specific knockout of manganese superoxide dismutase (aSOD2-KO), a mitochondrial matrix antioxidant that detoxifies superoxide generated during mitochondrial respiration. We reduced astrocyte SOD2 levels in male and female mice at 11&ndash;12 months of age and tested in an automated home cage (PhenoTyper) apparatus for diurnal patterns, spatial learning, and memory function at 15 months of age. aSOD2-KO impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory and decreased cognitive flexibility in the reversal phase of the testing paradigm in males. Female aSOD2-KO showed no learning and memory deficits compared with age-matched controls despite significant reduction in hippocampal SOD2 expression. aSOD2-KO males further showed decreased hippocampal long-term potentiation, but paired-pulse facilitation was unaffected. Levels of <scp>d</scp>-serine, an NMDA receptor coagonist, were also reduced in aSOD2-KO mice, but female knockouts showed a compensatory increase in serine racemase expression. Furthermore, aSOD2-KO mice demonstrated increased density of astrocytes, indicative of astrogliosis, in the hippocampus compared with age-matched controls. These data demonstrate that reduction in mitochondrial antioxidant stress response in astrocytes recapitulates age-related deficits in cognitive function, <scp>d</scp>-serine availability, and astrogliosis. Therefore, improving astrocyte mitochondrial homeostasis may provide a therapeutic target for intervention for cognitive impairment in aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Diminished antioxidant response is associated with increased astrogliosis in aging and in Alzheimer's disease. Manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) is an antioxidant in the mitochondrial matrix that detoxifies superoxide and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis. We show that astrocytic ablation of SOD2 impairs hippocampal-dependent plasticity in spatial working memory, reduces long-term potentiation of hippocampal neurons and levels of the neuromodulator <scp>d</scp>-serine, and increases astrogliosis, consistent with defects in advanced aging and Alzheimer's disease. Our data provide strong evidence for sex-specific effects of astrocytic SOD2 functions in age-related cognitive dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase Regulates Dscam Expression through a Noncanonical Function of the Cytoplasmic Poly(A)-Binding Protein</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) plays a pivotal role in the development, degeneration, and regeneration of neurons. DLK can regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The <I>Drosophila</I> DLK, Wallenda (Wnd), regulates the expression of Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) to control presynaptic arbor growth. This regulation is mediated by the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of <I>Dscam</I> mRNA, which suggests that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) mediate DLK function. We performed a genome-wide cell-based RNAi screen of RBPs and identified the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein, pAbp, as an RBP that mediates Wnd-induced increase in Dscam expression. Genetic analysis shows that Wnd requires <I>pAbp</I> for promoting presynaptic arbor growth and for enhancing Dscam expression. Our analysis revealed that <I>Dscam</I> mRNAs harbor short poly(A) tails. We identified a region in <I>Dscam</I> 3'UTR that specifically interacts with pAbp. Removing this region significantly reduced Wnd-induced increase in Dscam expression. These suggest that a noncanonical interaction of PABP with the 3'UTR of target transcripts is essential for DLK functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The kinase DLK plays key roles in a multitude of neuronal responses, including axon development, neurodegeneration, and nerve injury. Previous studies show that DLK acts via mRNAs to regulate protein synthesis, but how DLK does so is poorly understood. This study demonstrates that DLK regulates the synthesis of Dscam through the poly(A)-binding protein PABP-C. Whereas PABP-C is known as a general translational activator, our study shows that DLK-mediated Dscam expression involves a noncanonical interaction between PABP-C and the <I>Dscam</I> mRNA, which leads to a selective regulation of <I>Dscam</I> translation by PABP-C. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms that underlie the function of DLK and regulation of gene expression of PABP-C.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Meclizine and Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Agonists Attenuate Severe Pain and Ca2+ Activity of Primary Sensory Neurons in Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects ~68% of patients undergoing chemotherapy, causing debilitating neuropathic pain and reducing quality of life. Cisplatin is a commonly used platinum-based chemotherapeutic drug known to cause CIPN, possibly by causing oxidative stress damage to primary sensory neurons. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are widely hypothesized to be involved in pain processing and pain mitigation. Meclizine is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist known to have neuroprotective effects, including an anti-oxidative effect. Here, we used a mouse model of cisplatin-induced CIPN using male and female mice to test agonists of mGluR8 and Group II mGluR as well as meclizine as interventions to reduce cisplatin-induced pain. We performed behavioral pain tests, and we imaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of the large population of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons <I>in vivo</I>. For the latter, we used a genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Pirt-GCaMP3, which enabled us to monitor different drug interventions at the level of the intact DRG neuronal ensemble. We found that CIPN increased spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in DRG neurons, increased number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and increased hyper-responses to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. We found that mechanical and thermal pain caused by CIPN was significantly attenuated by the mGluR8 agonist, (S)&ndash;3,4-DCPG, the Group II mGluR agonist, LY379268, and the H1 histamine receptor antagonist, meclizine. DRG neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity elevated by CIPN was attenuated by LY379268 and meclizine, but not by (S)&ndash;3,4-DCPG. Furthermore, meclizine and LY379268 attenuated cisplatin-induced weight loss. These results suggest that Group II mGluR agonist, mGluR8 agonist, and meclizine are promising candidates as new treatment options for CIPN, and studies of their mechanisms are warranted.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a painful condition that affects most chemotherapy patients and persists several months or longer after treatment ends. Research on CIPN mechanism is extensive but has produced only few clinically useful treatments. Using <I>in vivo</I> GCaMP Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in live animals over 1800 neurons/dorsal root ganglia (DRG) at once, we have characterized the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin and three treatments that decrease CIPN pain. Cisplatin increases sensory neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and develops various sensitization. Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, LY379268 or the H1 histamine receptor antagonist, meclizine decreases cisplatin's effects on neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and reduces pain hypersensitivity. Our results and experiments provide insights into cellular effects of cisplatin and drugs preventing CIPN pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adenosine and Astrocytes Determine the Developmental Dynamics of Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity in the Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>During development, critical periods of synaptic plasticity facilitate the reordering and refinement of neural connections, allowing the definitive synaptic circuits responsible for correct adult physiology to be established. The L4&ndash;L2/3 synapses in the somatosensory cortex (S1) exhibit a presynaptic form of spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) that probably fulfills a role in synaptic refinement. This t-LTD persists until the fourth postnatal week in mice, disappearing thereafter. When we investigated the mechanisms underlying this maturation-related loss of t-LTD in either sex mouse slices, we found that it could be completely recovered by antagonizing adenosine type 1 receptors. By contrast, an agonist of A<SUB>1</SUB>R impeded the induction of t-LTD at P13&ndash;27. Furthermore, we found that the adenosine that mediated the loss of t-LTD at the end of the fourth week of development is most probably supplied by astrocytes. At more mature stages (P38&ndash;60), we found that the protocol used to induce t-LTD provokes t-LTP. We characterized the mechanisms underlying the induction of this form of LTP, and we found it to be expressed presynaptically, as witnessed by paired-pulse and coefficient of variation analysis. In addition, this form of presynaptic t-LTP requires the activation of NMDARs and mGlu1Rs, and the entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the postsynaptic neuron through L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Nitric oxide is also required for t-LTP as a messenger in the postsynaptic neuron as are the adenosine and glutamate that are released in association with astrocyte signaling. These results provide direct evidence of the mechanisms that close the window of plasticity associated with t-LTD and that drive the switch in synaptic transmission from t-LTD to t-LTP at L4&ndash;L2/3 synapses, in which astrocytes play a central role.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> During development, critical periods of plasticity facilitate the reordering and refining of neural connections, allowing correct adult physiology to be established.

We describe here these mechanisms and those involved in the switch from LTD to LTP observed as the brain matures. Defining these events responsible for closing (and opening) plasticity windows may be important for brain repair, sensorial recovery, the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, and for educational policy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Influence of Rat Central Thalamic Neurons on Foraging Behavior in a Hazardous Environment</a></h4>

              
                <p>Foraging entails a complex balance between approach and avoidance alongside sensorimotor and homeostatic processes under the control of multiple cortical and subcortical areas. Recently, it has become clear that several thalamic nuclei located near the midline regulate motivated behaviors. However, one midline thalamic nucleus that projects to key nodes in the foraging network, the central medial thalamic nucleus (CMT), has received little attention so far. Therefore, the present study examined CMT contributions to foraging behavior using inactivation and unit recording techniques in male rats. Inactivation of CMT or the basolateral amygdala (BLA) with muscimol abolished the normally cautious behavior of rats in the foraging task. Moreover, CMT neurons showed large but heterogeneous activity changes during the foraging task, with many neurons decreasing or increasing their discharge rates, with a modest bias for the latter. A generalized linear model revealed that the nature (inhibitory vs excitatory) and relative magnitude of the activity modulations seen in CMT neurons differed markedly from those of principal BLA cells but were very similar to those of fast-spiking BLA interneurons. Together, these findings suggest that CMT is an important regulator of foraging behavior. In the Discussion, we consider how CMT is integrated into the network of structures that regulate foraging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Foraging entails a complex balance between approach and avoidance alongside sensorimotor and homeostatic processes under the control of multiple cortical and subcortical areas. Although the central medial thalamic nucleus (CMT) is connected to many nodes in this network, its role in the regulation of foraging behavior has not been investigated so far. Here, we examined CMT contributions to foraging behavior using inactivation and unit recording techniques. We found that CMT inactivation abolishes the normally cautious foraging behavior of rats and that CMT neurons show large but heterogeneous changes in firing rates during the foraging task. Together, these results suggest that CMT is an important regulator of foraging behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pallidal Activity Related to Posture and Movement during Reaching in the Cat</a></h4>

              
                <p>We tested the hypothesis that the pallidum contributes to the control of both posture and movement. We recorded neuronal activity from the pallidum in a task in which male cats reached forward from a standing posture to depress a lever. In agreement with previous studies, we found that a majority of pallidal cells (91/116, 78%), including neurons in both the entopeduncular nucleus and the globus pallidus, showed significant modulation of their activity during reaching with the contralateral limb. Mostly different populations of cells were active during the transport (flexion) and lever press (extension) phase of the task. Most cells showed dynamic patterns of activity related to the movement. However, a modest proportion of modulated cells (18/91, 20%) showed properties consistent with a contribution to the control of anticipatory postural responses, whereas a further 10% showed activity consistent with a contribution to postural support during the movement. Although some cells that showed modified activity only during reaches with the contralateral forelimb, many cells (65/91, 71%) were also activated during reaches with the ipsilateral forelimb. This was particularly true for cells related to the lever press, many of which discharged similarly during reaches of either limb. This suggests a context-dependent control of movement and posture in which the same muscles are used for different functions during contralateral and ipsilateral reach. Comparison with the results from recordings made previously from the motor cortex and the pontomedullary reticular formation in the same task show more similarities with the former than the latter.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pathologic changes in basal ganglia function frequently lead to problems with postural stability and gait initiation. Here, we show that some neurons in one of the output regions of the basal ganglia, the pallidum, show discharge activity compatible with a contribution to postural control. At the same time, we note that such cells are a minority in this region with most cells being related to movement rather than posture. We also show that many neurons are active during movements of both the contralateral and ipsilateral limbs, sometimes with identical discharge patterns. We suggest that this indicates a context-dependent regulation of movement and posture in the pallidum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ras Inhibitor Lonafarnib Rescues Structural and Functional Impairments of Synapses of A{beta}1-42 Mice via {alpha}7nAChR-Dependent BDNF Upregulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the structural and functional impairments of synapses in the hippocampus, inducing the learning and memory deficiencies. Ras GTPase is closely related to the synaptic function and memory. This study was to investigate the effects of farnesyl transferase inhibitor lonafarnib on the synaptic structure and function in AD male mice and explore the potential mechanism. Our results showed 50 mg/kg lonafarnib (intraperitoneal) rescued the impaired spatial memory and improved the damaged synaptic transmission and plasticity of A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice. In addition, lonafarnib ameliorated the morphology of synaptic dendrites and spines in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice. Furthermore, lonafarnib enhanced &alpha;7nAChR cell surface expression and phosphorylation of downstream Akt and CaMKII in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice, which were inhibited by &alpha;7nAChR antagonist methyl lycaconitine (MLA), and increased the phosphorylation of CREB in a CaMKII- but not ERK-dependent way. Lonafarnib enhanced hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice, which was sensitive to MLA and KN93 (an inhibitor of CaMKII), but not related to ERK and Akt pathways. H-Ras, but not Rhes, was related to the lonafarnib induced improvement of &alpha;7nAChR cell surface expression and BDNF content. Interestingly, lonafarnib induced improvement of synaptic transmission, plasticity and spatial cognition in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice was abolished by BDNF deprivation with TrkB/Fc chimera protein. Our results indicate that lonafarnib can rescue the structural and functional impairments of synapses in the A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice, which may be related to the improvement of BDNF content through the H-Ras-&alpha;7nAChR-dependent CaMKII-CREB pathway, leading to the improvement of spatial cognition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the structural and functional impairments of synapses in the hippocampus, inducing the learning and memory deficiencies. However, no effective drugs have not been developed for the treatment of AD synaptic. This study for the first time reported the beneficial effects of Ras inhibitor lonafarnib on the synaptic structure and function in AD mice, providing an alternative way for the treatment of "synaptic disease" in AD patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Auditory and Visual Phase-Locking Are Observed during Audio-Visual Benefit and Silent Lip-Reading for Speech Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Speech perception in noisy environments is enhanced by seeing facial movements of communication partners. However, the neural mechanisms by which audio and visual speech are combined are not fully understood. We explore MEG phase-locking to auditory and visual signals in MEG recordings from 14 human participants (6 females, 8 males) that reported words from single spoken sentences. We manipulated the acoustic clarity and visual speech signals such that critical speech information is present in auditory, visual, or both modalities. MEG coherence analysis revealed that both auditory and visual speech envelopes (auditory amplitude modulations and lip aperture changes) were phase-locked to 2-6 Hz brain responses in auditory and visual cortex, consistent with entrainment to syllable-rate components. Partial coherence analysis was used to separate neural responses to correlated audio-visual signals and showed non-zero phase-locking to auditory envelope in occipital cortex during audio-visual (AV) speech. Furthermore, phase-locking to auditory signals in visual cortex was enhanced for AV speech compared with audio-only speech that was matched for intelligibility. Conversely, auditory regions of the superior temporal gyrus did not show above-chance partial coherence with visual speech signals during AV conditions but did show partial coherence in visual-only conditions. Hence, visual speech enabled stronger phase-locking to auditory signals in visual areas, whereas phase-locking of visual speech in auditory regions only occurred during silent lip-reading. Differences in these cross-modal interactions between auditory and visual speech signals are interpreted in line with cross-modal predictive mechanisms during speech perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Verbal communication in noisy environments is challenging, especially for hearing-impaired individuals. Seeing facial movements of communication partners improves speech perception when auditory signals are degraded or absent. The neural mechanisms supporting lip-reading or audio-visual benefit are not fully understood. Using MEG recordings and partial coherence analysis, we show that speech information is used differently in brain regions that respond to auditory and visual speech. While visual areas use visual speech to improve phase-locking to auditory speech signals, auditory areas do not show phase-locking to visual speech unless auditory speech is absent and visual speech is used to substitute for missing auditory signals. These findings highlight brain processes that combine visual and auditory signals to support speech understanding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sensorimotor Cortex GABA Moderates the Relationship between Physical Exertion and Assessments of Effort</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experiences of physical exertion guide our assessments of effort. While these assessments critically influence our decisions to engage in daily activities, little is known about how they are generated. We had female and male human participants exert grip force and assess how effortful these exertions felt; and used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure their brain GABA concentration. We found that variability in exertion (i.e., the coefficient of variation in their force exertion profile) was associated with increases in assessments of effort, making participants judge efforts as more costly. GABA levels in the sensorimotor cortex (SM1) moderated the influence of exertion variability on overassessments of effort. In individuals with higher sensorimotor GABA, exertion variability had a diminished influence on overassessments of effort. Essentially, sensorimotor GABA had a protective effect on the influence of exertion variability on inflations of effort assessment. Our findings provide a neurobiological account of how the brain's GABAergic system integrates features of physical exertion into judgments of effort, and how basic sensorimotor properties may influence higher-order judgments of effort.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Feelings of effort critically shape our decisions to partake in activities of daily living. It remains unclear how the brain translates physical activity into judgments about effort (i.e., "How effortful did that activity feel?"). Using modeling of behavior and neuroimaging, we show how the nervous system uses information about physical exertion to generate assessments of effort. We found that higher variability in exertion was associated with increases in assessments of effort, making participants judge efforts as more costly. GABA, the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter, moderated the influence of exertion variability on overassessments of effort. These findings illustrate how low-level features of motor performance and sensorimotor neurochemistry influence higher-order cognitive processes related to feelings of effort.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Transfer of Tactile Learning from Trained to Untrained Body Parts Supported by Cortical Coactivation in Primary Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>A pioneering study by <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">Volkmann (1858)</cross-ref> revealed that training on a tactile discrimination task improved task performance, indicative of tactile learning, and that such tactile learning transferred from trained to untrained body parts. However, the neural mechanisms underlying tactile learning and transfer of tactile learning have remained unclear. We trained groups of human subjects (female and male) in daily sessions on a tactile discrimination task either by stimulating the palm of the right hand or the sole of the right foot. Task performance before training was similar between the palm and sole. Posttraining transfer of tactile learning was greater from the trained right sole to the untrained right palm than from the trained right palm to the untrained right sole. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern classification analysis revealed that the somatotopic representation of the right palm in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) was coactivated during tactile stimulation of the right sole. More pronounced coactivation in the cortical representation of the right palm was associated with lower tactile performance for tactile stimulation of the right sole and more pronounced subsequent transfer of tactile learning from the trained right sole to the untrained right palm. In contrast, coactivation of the cortical sole representation during tactile stimulation of the palm was less pronounced and no association with tactile performance and subsequent transfer of tactile learning was found. These results indicate that tactile learning may transfer to untrained body parts that are coactivated to support tactile learning with the trained body part.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perceptual skills such as the discrimination of tactile cues can improve by means of training, indicative of perceptual learning and sensory plasticity. However, it has remained unclear whether and if so, how such perceptual learning can occur if the training task is very difficult. Here, we show for tactile perceptual learning that the representation of the palm of the hand in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) is coactivated to support learning of a difficult tactile discrimination task with tactile stimulation of the sole of the foot. Such cortical coactivation of an untrained body part to support tactile learning with a trained body part might be critically involved in the subsequent transfer of tactile learning between the trained and untrained body parts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Altered Development of Amygdala-Connected Brain Regions in Males and Females with Autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Altered amygdala development is implicated in the neurobiology of autism, but little is known about the coordinated development of the brain regions directly connected with the amygdala. Here we investigated the volumetric development of an amygdala-connected network, defined as the set of brain regions with monosynaptic connections with the amygdala, in autism from early to middle childhood. A total of 950 longitudinal structural MRI scans were acquired from 282 children (93 female) with autism and 128 children with typical development (61 female) at up to four time points (mean ages: 39, 52, 64, and 137 months, respectively). Volumes from 32 amygdala-connected brain regions were examined using mixed effects multivariate distance matrix regression. The Social Responsiveness Scale-2 was administered to assess degree of autistic traits and social impairments. The amygdala-connected network exhibited persistent diagnostic differences (<I>p</I> values &le; 0.03) that increased over time (<I>p</I> values &le; 0.02). These differences were most prominent in autistics with more impacted social functioning at baseline. This pattern was not observed across regions without monosynaptic amygdala connection. We observed qualitative sex differences. In males, the bilateral subgenual anterior cingulate cortices were most affected, while in females the left fusiform and superior temporal gyri were most affected. In conclusion, (1) autism is associated with widespread alterations to the development of brain regions connected with the amygdala, which were associated with autistic social behaviors; and (2) autistic males and females exhibited different patterns of alterations, adding to a growing body of evidence of sex differences in the neurobiology of autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Global patterns of development across brain regions with monosynaptic connection to the amygdala differentiate autism from typical development, and are modulated by social functioning in early childhood. Alterations to brain regions within the amygdala-connected network differed in males and females with autism. Results also indicate larger volumetric differences in regions having monosynaptic connection with the amygdala than in regions without monosynaptic connection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Three Dimensions of Association Link Migraine Symptoms and Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Migraine is a heterogeneous disorder with variable symptoms and responsiveness to therapy. Because of previous analytic shortcomings, variance in migraine symptoms has been inconsistently related to brain function. In the current analysis, we used data from two sites (<I>n</I> = 143, male and female humans), and performed canonical correlation analysis, relating resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) with a broad range of migraine symptoms, ranging from headache characteristics to sleep abnormalities. This identified three dimensions of covariance between symptoms and RSFC. The first dimension related to headache intensity, headache frequency, pain catastrophizing, affect, sleep disturbances, and somatic abnormalities, and was associated with frontoparietal and dorsal attention network connectivity, both of which are major cognitive networks. Additionally, RSFC scores from this dimension, both the baseline value and the change from baseline to postintervention, were associated with responsiveness to mind-body therapy. The second dimension was related to an inverse association between pain and anxiety, and to default mode network connectivity. The final dimension was related to pain catastrophizing, and salience, sensorimotor, and default mode network connectivity. In addition to performing canonical correlation analysis, we evaluated the current clustering of migraine patients into episodic and chronic subtypes, and found no evidence to support this clustering. However, when using RSFC scores from the three significant dimensions, we identified a novel clustering of migraine patients into four biotypes with unique functional connectivity patterns. These findings provide new insight into individual variability in migraine, and could serve as the foundation for novel therapies that take advantage of migraine heterogeneity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Using a large multisite dataset of migraine patients, we identified three dimensions of multivariate association between symptoms and functional connectivity. This analysis revealed neural networks that relate to all measured symptoms, but also to specific symptom ensembles, such as patient propensity to catastrophize painful events. Using these three dimensions, we found four biotypes of migraine informed by clinical and neural variation together. Such findings pave the way for precision medicine therapy for migraine.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neural networks for self-adjusting mutation rate estimation when the recombination rate is unknown</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Klara Elisabeth Burger, Peter Pfaffelhuber, Franz Baumdicker</p>

Estimating the mutation rate, or equivalently effective population size, is a common task in population genetics. If recombination is low or high, optimal linear estimation methods are known and well understood. For intermediate recombination rates, the calculation of optimal estimators is more challenging. As an alternative to model-based estimation, neural networks and other machine learning tools could help to develop good estimators in these involved scenarios. However, if no benchmark is available it is difficult to assess how well suited these tools are for different applications in population genetics.
Here we investigate feedforward neural networks for the estimation of the mutation rate based on the site frequency spectrum and compare their performance with model-based estimators. For this we use the model-based estimators introduced by Fu, Futschik et al., and Watterson that minimize the variance or mean square error for no and free recombination. We find that neural networks reproduce these estimators if provided with the appropriate features and training sets. Remarkably, using the model-based estimators to adjust the weights of the training data, only one hidden layer is necessary to obtain a single estimator that performs almost as well as model-based estimators for low and high recombination rates, and at the same time provides a superior estimation method for intermediate recombination rates. We apply the method to simulated data based on the human chromosome 2 recombination map, highlighting its robustness in a realistic setting where local recombination rates vary and/or are unknown.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for maximizing the recommendations of the NIH data management and sharing plan</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sara Gonzales, Matthew B. Carson, Kristi Holmes</p>

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Policy for Data Management and Sharing (DMS Policy) recognizes the NIH’s role as a key steward of United States biomedical research and information and seeks to enhance that stewardship through systematic recommendations for the preservation and sharing of research data generated by funded projects. The policy is effective as of January 2023. The recommendations include a requirement for the submission of a Data Management and Sharing Plan (DMSP) with funding applications, and while no strict template was provided, the NIH has released supplemental draft guidance on elements to consider when developing a plan. This article provides 10 key recommendations for creating a DMSP that is both maximally compliant and effective.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Type 2 diabetes disrupts circadian orchestration of lipid metabolism and membrane fluidity in human pancreatic islets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Volodymyr Petrenko, Flore Sinturel, Ursula Loizides-Mangold, Jonathan Paz Montoya, Simona Chera, Howard Riezman, Charna Dibner</p>

Recent evidence suggests that circadian clocks ensure temporal orchestration of lipid homeostasis and play a role in pathophysiology of metabolic diseases in humans, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Nevertheless, circadian regulation of lipid metabolism in human pancreatic islets has not been explored. Employing lipidomic analyses, we conducted temporal profiling in human pancreatic islets derived from 10 nondiabetic (ND) and 6 T2D donors. Among 329 detected lipid species across 8 major lipid classes, 5% exhibited circadian rhythmicity in ND human islets synchronized in vitro. Two-time point-based lipidomic analyses in T2D human islets revealed global and temporal alterations in phospho- and sphingolipids. Key enzymes regulating turnover of sphingolipids were rhythmically expressed in ND islets and exhibited altered levels in ND islets bearing disrupted clocks and in T2D islets. Strikingly, cellular membrane fluidity, measured by a Nile Red derivative NR12S, was reduced in plasma membrane of T2D diabetic human islets, in ND donors’ islets with disrupted circadian clockwork, or treated with sphingolipid pathway modulators. Moreover, inhibiting the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis led to strong reduction of insulin secretion triggered by glucose or KCl, whereas inhibiting earlier steps of de novo ceramide synthesis resulted in milder inhibitory effect on insulin secretion by ND islets. Our data suggest that circadian clocks operative in human pancreatic islets are required for temporal orchestration of lipid homeostasis, and that perturbation of temporal regulation of the islet lipid metabolism upon T2D leads to altered insulin secretion and membrane fluidity. These phenotypes were recapitulated in ND islets bearing disrupted clocks.
