	<p>Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at risk for challenges with aspects of executive function (EF). The current study explores whether heterogeneity in EF profiles can be detected within a sample of children with DS. Participants were 69 children with DS, ages 3&amp;amp;ndash;10 years (M = 6.23, SD = 1.91). T-scores from a caregiver-report measure of executive function were modeled using latent profile analysis, and auxiliary analyses examined the association between demographic and biomedical factors and probability of profile membership. The two-profile solution was the best fit for the sample, with a profile that involved elevated scores in working memory only (&amp;amp;ldquo;Working Memory Only&amp;amp;rdquo; profile; 43% of sample) and a &amp;amp;ldquo;Multi-Domain&amp;amp;rdquo; profile that involved elevated scores in planning, inhibition, and working memory (57%). The presence of congenital heart defects was associated with a higher probability of assignment to the Multi-Domain profile. Findings from this study contribute to the characterization of heterogeneous outcomes associated with DS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico comparison between the mutated and wild-type androgen receptors and their influence on the selection of optimum androgenic receptor blockers for the treatment of prostate cancer [version 3; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prostate cancer is a disease that occurs in men aged more than 50 years. In Iraq, 8.89 men per 100,000 population suffer from prostate cancer, with the incidence being 14,016 cases and mortality being 6,367 cases. Despite advances in treatment against prostate cancer, it can become resistant to drugs. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to search and identify binding sites for the repositioning of drugs by computational methods (docking).  Methods: Based on the protein structure of the wild androgen receptor, the analysis parameters (22x22x22 on the X, Y, and Z axes) were established. Results: The interactions of the natural ligands with androgen receptor were 10.0 (testosterone) and 10.8 (dihydrotestosterone) while mutated androgen receptor (T877A) had a low affinity with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (-5.3 and -6.7, respectively). In the interactions of both receptors with the reported inhibitors (antagonists), a decrease with Bicalutamide (-8.3 and -4.3, respectively) and an increase in affinity with Flutamide and Nilutamide (-7.7 and 8.6, wild AR; -8.7 and -9.3 AR T877A) were observed. As for Enzalutamide and Apalutamide (second-generation antagonists), the change was minimal between wild androgen receptor and T877A (-7.6 and -7.7; -7.3 and -7.3, respectively). The change in the affinity of the ligands with the androgen receptor and androgen receptor T877A shows how a mutation alters the bonds between these molecules. Conclusion: The identification of key sites and potent inhibitors against abnormal androgen receptor functions will enrich prostate cancer treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A general hypothesis of multistable systems in pathophysiology [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Despite intensive investigations numerous diseases remain etiologically puzzling and recalcitrant to treatments. A hypothesis is proposed here assuming that these difficulties are due to an unsuitable approach to the mechanisms of life, which is subjugated by an apparent complexity and fails to grasp the uniformity that lays behind. The stability of metabolism, despite the enormous complex of chemical reactions, suggests that reciprocal control is a prerequisite of life. Negative feedback loops have been known for a long time to maintain homeostasis, while more recently, different life processes involved in transitions or changes have been modeled by positive loops giving rise to bistable switches, also including various diseases. The present hypothesis makes a generalization, by assuming that any functional element of a biological system is involved in a positive or a negative feedback loop. Consequently, the hypothesis holds that the starting mechanism of any disease that affects a healthy human can be conceptually reduced to a bistable or multistationary loop system, thus providing a unifying model leading to the discovery of critical therapeutic targets.

                Background: Although nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a significant risk of spreading to other parts of the body early, orbital and ocular surrounding tissues metastases are uncommon. Case Report: This paper described a 16-year-old patient diagnosed with a locally advanced NPC and ocular metastasis and was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. One of the rare early presentations is orbital metastases with vision problems. Discussion: Orbital metastases in children are considerably more uncommon. Cachexia and malnutrition are prevalent problems in people with cancer, affecting life and longevity. Anaemia is a severe issue for nasopharyngeal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Conclusion: Orbital metastases frequently arise in advanced stages of the disease and in the scenario of many metastases the persistence of therapy and the nasopharyngeal cancer patient's standard of living is linked to the occurrence of anaemia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Laboratory protocol for the digital multiplexed gene expression analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples using the NanoString nCounter system [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                This paper describes a laboratory protocol to perform the NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay from nasopharyngeal swab samples.  It is urgently necessary to identify factors related to severe symptoms of respiratory infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in order to assess the possibility of establishing preventive or preliminary therapeutic measures and to plan the services to be provided on hospital admission. At present, the samples recommended for microbiological diagnosis are those taken from the upper and/or the lower respiratory tract.  The NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay is a method based on the direct digital detection of mRNA molecules by means of target-specific, colour-coded probe pairs, without the need for mRNA conversion to cDNA by reverse transcription or the amplification of the resulting cDNA by PCR. This platform includes advanced analysis tools that reduce the need for bioinformatics support and also offers reliable sensitivity, reproducibility, technical robustness and utility for clinical application, even in RNA samples of low RNA quality or concentration, such as paraffin-embedded samples. Although the protocols for the analysis of blood or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples are provided by the manufacturer, no corresponding protocol for the analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples has yet been established. Therefore, the approach we describe could be adopted to determine the expression of target genes in samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs using the nCOUNTER technology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational multiplex panel reduction to maximize information retention in breast cancer tissue microarrays</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luke Ternes, Jia-Ren Lin, Yu-An Chen, Joe W. Gray, Young Hwan Chang</p>

Recent state-of-the-art multiplex imaging techniques have expanded the depth of information that can be captured within a single tissue sample by allowing for panels with dozens of markers. Despite this increase in capacity, space on the panel is still limited due to technical artifacts, tissue loss, and long imaging acquisition time. As such, selecting which markers to include on a panel is important, since removing important markers will result in a loss of biologically relevant information, but identifying redundant markers will provide a room for other markers. To address this, we propose computational approaches to determine the amount of shared information between markers and select an optimally reduced panel that captures maximum amount of information with the fewest markers. Here we examine several panel selection approaches and evaluate them based on their ability to reconstruct the full panel images and information within breast cancer tissue microarray datasets using cyclic immunofluorescence as a proof of concept. We show that all methods perform adequately and can re-capture cell types using only 18 of 25 markers (72% of the original panel size). The correlation-based selection methods achieved the best single-cell marker mean intensity predictions with a Spearman correlation of 0.90 with the reduced panel. Using the proposed methods shown here, it is possible for researchers to design more efficient multiplex imaging panels that maximize the amount of information retained with the limited number of markers with respect to certain evaluation metrics and architecture biases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">HAYSTAC: A Bayesian framework for robust and rapid species identification in high-throughput sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Evangelos A. Dimopoulos, Alberto Carmagnini, Irina M. Velsko, Christina Warinner, Greger Larson, Laurent A. F. Frantz, Evan K. Irving-Pease</p>

Identification of specific species in metagenomic samples is critical for several key applications, yet many tools available require large computational power and are often prone to false positive identifications. Here we describe High-AccuracY and Scalable Taxonomic Assignment of MetagenomiC data (HAYSTAC), which can estimate the probability that a specific taxon is present in a metagenome. HAYSTAC provides a user-friendly tool to construct databases, based on publicly available genomes, that are used for competitive reads mapping. It then uses a novel Bayesian framework to infer the abundance and statistical support for each species identification and provide per-read species classification. Unlike other methods, HAYSTAC is specifically designed to efficiently handle both ancient and modern DNA data, as well as incomplete reference databases, making it possible to run highly accurate hypothesis-driven analyses (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., assessing the presence of a specific species) on variably sized reference databases while dramatically improving processing speeds. We tested the performance and accuracy of HAYSTAC using simulated Illumina libraries, both with and without ancient DNA damage, and compared the results to other currently available methods (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq, MALT/HOPS, and Sigma). HAYSTAC identified fewer false positives than both Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq and MALT in all simulations, and fewer than Sigma in simulations of ancient data. It uses less memory than Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq as well as MALT both during database construction and sample analysis. Lastly, we used HAYSTAC to search for specific pathogens in two published ancient metagenomic datasets, demonstrating how it can be applied to empirical datasets. HAYSTAC is available from https://github.com/antonisdim/HAYSTAC.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A hierarchical process model links behavioral aging and lifespan in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natasha Oswal, Olivier M. F. Martin, Sofia Stroustrup, Monika Anna Matusiak Bruckner, Nicholas Stroustrup</p>

Aging involves a transition from youthful vigor to geriatric infirmity and death. Individuals who remain vigorous longer tend to live longer, and within isogenic populations of <i>C</i>. <i>elegan</i>s the timing of age-associated vigorous movement cessation (VMC) is highly correlated with lifespan. Yet, many mutations and interventions in aging alter the proportion of lifespan spent moving vigorously, appearing to “uncouple” youthful vigor from lifespan. To clarify the relationship between vigorous movement cessation, death, and the physical declines that determine their timing, we developed a new version of the imaging platform called “The Lifespan Machine”. This technology allows us to compare behavioral aging and lifespan at an unprecedented scale. We find that behavioral aging involves a time-dependent increase in the risk of VMC, reminiscent of the risk of death. Furthermore, we find that VMC times are inversely correlated with remaining lifespan across a wide range of genotypes and environmental conditions. Measuring and modelling a variety of lifespan-altering interventions including a new RNA-polymerase II auxin-inducible degron system, we find that vigorous movement and lifespan are best described as emerging from the interplay between at least two distinct physical declines whose rates co-vary between individuals. In this way, we highlight a crucial limitation of predictors of lifespan like VMC—in organisms experiencing multiple, distinct, age-associated physical declines, correlations between mid-life biomarkers and late-life outcomes can arise from the contextual influence of confounding factors rather than a reporting by the biomarker of a robustly predictive biological age.

Despite increased understanding about psoriasis pathophysiology, currently there is a lack of predictive computational models. We developed a personalisable ordinary differential equations model of human epidermis and psoriasis that incorporates immune cells and cytokine stimuli to regulate the transition between two stable steady states of clinically healthy (non-lesional) and disease (lesional psoriasis, plaque) skin. In line with experimental data, an immune stimulus initiated transition from healthy skin to psoriasis and apoptosis of immune and epidermal cells induced by UVB phototherapy returned the epidermis back to the healthy state. Notably, our model was able to distinguish disease flares. The flexibility of our model permitted the development of a patient-specific “UVB sensitivity” parameter that reflected subject-specific sensitivity to apoptosis and enabled simulation of individual patients’ clinical response trajectory. In a prospective clinical study of 94 patients, serial individual UVB doses and clinical response (Psoriasis Area Severity Index) values collected over the first three weeks of UVB therapy informed estimation of the “UVB sensitivity” parameter and the prediction of individual patient outcome at the end of phototherapy. An important advance of our model is its potential for direct clinical application through early assessment of response to UVB therapy, and for individualised optimisation of phototherapy regimes to improve clinical outcome. Additionally by incorporating the complex interaction of immune cells and epidermal keratinocytes, our model provides a basis to study and predict outcomes to biologic therapies in psoriasis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Prior fear learning enables the rapid assimilation of new fear memories directly into cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giulia Concina, Annamaria Renna, Luisella Milano, Benedetto Sacchetti</p>

Long-term memory formation involves the reorganization of brain circuits, termed system consolidation. Whether and how a prior fear experience influences system consolidation of new memories is poorly understood. In rats, we found that prior auditory fear learning allows the secondary auditory cortex to immediately encode new auditory memories, with these new memories purely requiring the activation of cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation within secondary auditory cortex. Similar results were obtained in the anterior cingulate cortex for contextual fear memories. Moreover, prior learning enabled connections from these cortices to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to support recent memory retention. We propose that the reorganization of circuits that characterizes system consolidation occurs only in the first instance that an event is learned, subsequently allowing the immediate assimilation of new analogous events in final storage sites.

    , a diffraction-limited, circularly polarized optical pump breaks symmetry between oppositely polarized magnetic states and stabilizes long-range magnetic order, with carrier polarization exceeding 80% over an 8 μm by 5 μm extent. In time-resolved measurements with pulsed optical excitation, we observe that magnetic interactions amplify the initial pump-induced spin polarization by more than an order of magnitude. The optical control of magnetism with local optical pumps will unlock advancements in spin and optical technologies and provides a versatile tool in the study of correlated phases in two-dimensional electron gases.

    Nonlinear phenomena in physical systems can be used for brain-inspired computing with low energy consumption. Response from the dynamics of a topological spin structure called skyrmion is one of the candidates for such a neuromorphic computing. However, its ability has not been well explored experimentally. Here, we experimentally demonstrate neuromorphic computing using nonlinear response originating from magnetic field–induced dynamics of skyrmions. We designed a simple-structured skyrmion-based neuromorphic device and succeeded in handwritten digit recognition with the accuracy as large as 94.7% and waveform recognition. Notably, there exists a positive correlation between the recognition accuracy and the number of skyrmions in the devices. The large degrees of freedom of skyrmion systems, such as the position and the size, originate from the more complex nonlinear mapping, the larger output dimension, and, thus, high accuracy. Our results provide a guideline for developing energy-saving and high-performance skyrmion neuromorphic computing devices.

    The accurate expression of postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) is critical for information processing in the brain, and ubiquitination is a key regulator for this biological process. However, the roles of E3 ubiquitin ligases in the regulation of AMPARs are poorly understood. Here, we find that RNF220 directly interacts with AMPARs to meditate their polyubiquitination, and RNF220 knockout specifically increases AMPAR protein levels, thereby enhancing basal synaptic activity while impairing synaptic plasticity. Moreover, depending on its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, RNF220 represses AMPAR-mediated excitatory synaptic responses and their neuronal surface expression. Furthermore, learning and memory are altered in forebrain RNF220-deficient mice. In addition, two neuropathology-related RNF220 variants fail to repress excitatory synaptic activity because of the incapability to regulate AMPAR ubiquitination due to their attenuated interaction. Together, we identify RNF220 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for AMPARs and establish its substantial role in excitatory synaptic transmission and brain function.

    Blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury critically exacerbates the poor prognosis of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The massively increased matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9) plays a deleterious role in BBB. However, the main source and mechanism of MMP-9 production after SAH remain unclear. We reported that the increased MMP-9 was mainly derived from reactive astrocytes after SAH.
    <i>

    knockout in astrocytes inhibited MMP-9 expression after SAH and attenuated BBB damage. Astrocytic
    <i>
     Ndrg2
    </i>
    knockout decreased the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and the transcription of MMP-9. Notably, cytoplasmic NDRG2 bound to the protein phosphatase PPM1A and restricted the dephosphorylation of Smad2/3. Accordingly, TAT-QFNP12, a novel engineered peptide that could block the NDRG2-PPM1A binding and reduce Smad2/3 dephosphorylation, decreased astrocytic MMP-9 production and BBB disruption after SAH. In conclusion, this study identified NDRG2-PPM1A signaling in reactive astrocytes as a key switch for MMP-9 production and provided a novel therapeutic avenue for BBB protection after SAH.

    The fate of pyruvate is a defining feature in many cell types. One major fate is mitochondrial entry via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). We found that diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) consume mitochondrial pyruvate via glutamate-pyruvate transaminase 2 to enable α-ketoglutarate production as part of glutaminolysis. This led us to discover that glutamine exceeds pyruvate as a carbon source for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in DLBCLs. As a result, MPC inhibition led to decreased glutaminolysis in DLBCLs, opposite to previous observations in other cell types. We also found that MPC inhibition or genetic depletion decreased DLBCL proliferation in an extracellular matrix (ECM)–like environment and xenografts, but not in a suspension environment. Moreover, the metabolic profile of DLBCL cells in ECM is markedly different from cells in a suspension environment. Thus, we conclude that the synergistic consumption and assimilation of glutamine and pyruvate enables DLBCL proliferation in an extracellular environment-dependent manner.

    How do neurons match generation of adenosine triphosphate by mitochondria to the bioenergetic demands of regenerative activity? Although the subject of speculation, this coupling is still poorly understood, particularly in neurons that are tonically active. To help fill this gap, pacemaking substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons were studied using a combination of optical, electrophysiological, and molecular approaches.

Disrupting either mechanism impaired the ability of dopaminergic neurons to sustain spike activity. While this feedforward control helps dopaminergic neurons meet the bioenergetic demands associated with sustained spiking, it is also responsible for their elevated oxidant stress and possibly to their decline with aging and disease.

Strong electronic correlations lead to exotic electronic ground states, including magnetic order, nematicity, and unconventional superconductivity.

    Infectious diseases are an increasing threat to coral reefs, resulting in altered community structure and hindering the functional contributions of disease-susceptible species. We exposed seven reef-building coral species from the Caribbean to white plague disease and determined processes involved in (i) lesion progression, (ii) within-species gene expression plasticity, and (iii) expression-level adaptation among species that lead to differences in disease risk. Gene expression networks enriched in immune genes and cytoskeletal arrangement processes were correlated to lesion progression rates. Whether or not a coral developed a lesion was mediated by plasticity in genes involved in extracellular matrix maintenance, autophagy, and apoptosis, while resistant coral species had constitutively higher expression of intracellular protein trafficking. This study offers insight into the process involved in lesion progression and within- and between-species dynamics that lead to differences in disease risk that is evident on current Caribbean reefs.

    Graphene metamaterials with a radial-like structure and negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) were assembled using a unique centripetal freezing technique. Driven by the centripetal temperature gradient, ice crystals were grown toward the center of an aqueous graphene dispersion and form a radially arranged skeleton. A reentrant structure was formed at the diagonal of the monolith as the ice crystals sublimate. The obtained centripetal graphene metamaterial (CGM) was endowed with NPR response. CGM maintained NPR under 50% compression, which reached a minimum (−0.18) at 10% strain. After 50 compressive cycles at 50% strain, CGM retained approximately 96% of the original compressive strength. The radial channels endowed CGM with fast absorption kinetics, and the NPR response effectively accommodated the damage caused by volume shrinkage during repeated adsorption-regeneration cycles. This strategy is an effective method for achieving NPR response and improving the mechanical properties of porous materials.

    Identification of new markers associated with long-term efficacy in patients treated with CAR T cells is a current medical need, particularly in diseases such as multiple myeloma. In this study, we address the impact of CAR density on the functionality of BCMA CAR T cells. Functional and transcriptional studies demonstrate that CAR T cells with high expression of the CAR construct show an increased tonic signaling with up-regulation of exhaustion markers and increased in vitro cytotoxicity but a decrease in in vivo BM infiltration.

    We offer comprehensive evidence of preferences for ideological congruity when people engage with politicians, pundits, and news organizations on social media. Using 4 years of data (2016–2019) from a random sample of 1.5 million Twitter users, we examine three behaviors studied separately to date: (i) following of in-group versus out-group elites, (ii) sharing in-group versus out-group information (retweeting), and (iii) commenting on the shared information (quote tweeting). We find that the majority of users (60%) do not follow any political elites. Those who do follow in-group elite accounts at much higher rates than out-group accounts (90 versus 10%), share information from in-group elites 13 times more frequently than from out-group elites, and often add negative comments to the shared out-group information. Conservatives are twice as likely as liberals to share in-group versus out-group content. These patterns are robust, emerge across issues and political elites, and exist regardless of users’ ideological extremity.

   <div>
    Our inability to derive the neuronal diversity that comprises the posterior central nervous system (pCNS) using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) poses an impediment to understanding human neurodevelopment and disease in the hindbrain and spinal cord. Here, we establish a modular, monolayer differentiation paradigm that recapitulates both rostrocaudal (R/C) and dorsoventral (D/V) patterning, enabling derivation of diverse pCNS neurons with discrete regional specificity. First, neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) with discrete
    <i>
     HOX
    </i>
    profiles are converted to pCNS progenitors (pCNSPs). Then, by tuning D/V signaling, pCNSPs are directed to locomotor or somatosensory neurons. Expansive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis coupled with a novel computational pipeline allowed us to detect hundreds of transcriptional markers within region-specific phenotypes, enabling discovery of gene expression patterns across R/C and D/V developmental axes. These findings highlight the potential of these resources to advance a mechanistic understanding of pCNS development, enhance in vitro models, and inform therapeutic strategies.

    Primary visual cortices in many mammalian species exhibit modular and periodic orientation preference maps arranged in pinwheel-like layouts. The role of inherited traits as opposed to environmental influences in determining this organization remains unclear. Here, we characterize the cortical organization of an Australian marsupial, revealing pinwheel organization resembling that of eutherian carnivores and primates but distinctly different from the simpler salt-and-pepper arrangement of eutherian rodents and rabbits. The divergence of marsupials from eutherians 160 million years ago and the later emergence of rodents and rabbits suggest that the salt-and-pepper structure is not the primitive ancestral form. Rather, the genetic code that enables complex pinwheel formation is likely widespread, perhaps extending back to the common therian ancestors of modern mammals.

    Mutualism between
    <i>

    and heterotrophic bacteria has been found to support their prolonged survival in nutrient-depleted conditions. However, environmental interference on the fate of their mutualism is not understood. Here, we show that exogenous nutrients disrupt their established mutualism. Once the exogenous nutrients were exhausted,
    <i>
     Synechococcus
    </i>
    and heterotrophic bacteria gradually reestablished their metabolic mutualism during 450 days of culture, which revived unhealthy
    <i>

    cells. Using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and the
    <sup>

    <i>

    health. During this process, bacterial community structure and functions underwent tremendous adjustments to achieve the driving effect, and a cogeneration of nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and vitamin by the heterotrophic bacteria sustained

While neural ensemble recordings have been available for decades, progress in high-resolution manipulation techniques has lagged behind.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In vivo generation of bone marrow from embryonic stem cells in interspecies chimeras</a></h4>

              
                Generation of bone marrow (BM) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) promises to accelerate the development of future cell therapies for life-threatening disorders. However, such approach is limited by technical challenges to produce a mixture of functional BM progenitor cells able to replace all hematopoietic cell lineages. Herein, we used blastocyst complementation to simultaneously produce BM cell lineages from mouse ESCs in a rat. Based on FACS analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing, mouse ESCs differentiated into multiple hematopoietic and stromal cell types that were indistinguishable from normal mouse BM cells based on gene expression signatures and cell surface markers. Receptor-ligand interactions identified <i>Cxcl12-Cxcr4</i>, <i>Lama2-Itga6, App-Itga6</i>, <i>Comp-Cd47</i>, <i>Col1a1-Cd44</i> and <i>App-Il18rap</i> as major signaling pathways between hematopoietic progenitors and stromal cells. Multiple hematopoietic progenitors, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mouse-rat chimeras derived more efficiently from mouse ESCs, whereas chondrocytes predominantly derived from rat cells. In the dorsal aorta and fetal liver of mouse-rat chimeras, mouse HSCs emerged and expanded faster compared to endogenous rat cells. Sequential BM transplantation of ESC-derived cells from mouse-rat chimeras rescued lethally-irradiated syngeneic mice and demonstrated long-term reconstitution potential of donor HSCs. Altogether, a fully functional bone marrow was generated from mouse ESCs using rat embryos as 'bioreactors'.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of orphan ligand-receptor relationships using a cell-based CRISPRa enrichment screening platform</a></h4>

              
                Secreted proteins, which include cytokines, hormones and growth factors, are extracellular ligands that control key signaling pathways mediating cell-cell communication within and between tissues and organs. Many drugs target secreted ligands and their cell-surface receptors. Still, there are hundreds of secreted human proteins that either have no identified receptors ('orphans') and are likely to act through cell surface receptors that have not yet been characterized. Discovery of secreted ligand-receptor interactions by high-throughput screening has been problematic, because the most commonly used high-throughput methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) screening do not work well for extracellular interactions. Cell-based screening is a promising technology for definition of new ligand-receptor interactions, because multimerized ligands can enrich for cells expressing low affinity cell-surface receptors, and such methods do not require purification of receptor extracellular domains. Here, we present a proteo-genomic cell-based CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) enrichment screening platform employing customized pooled cell surface receptor sgRNA libraries in combination with a magnetic bead selection-based enrichment workflow for rapid, parallel ligand-receptor deorphanization. We curated 80 potentially high value orphan secreted proteins and ultimately screened 20 secreted ligands against two cell sgRNA libraries with targeted expression of all single-pass (TM1) or multi-pass (TM2+) receptors by CRISPRa. We identified previously unknown interactions in 12 of these screens, and validated several of them using surface plasmon resonance and/or cell binding. The newly deorphanized ligands include three receptor tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) ligands and a chemokine like protein that binds to killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR's). These new interactions provide a resource for future investigations of interactions between the human secreted and membrane proteomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Airway basal cells show regionallydistinct potential to undergo metaplastic differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Basal cells are multipotent stem cells of a variety of organs, including the respiratory tract, where they are major components of the airway epithelium. However, it remains unclear how diverse basal cells are, and how distinct subpopulations respond to airway challenges. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and functional approaches, we report a significant and previously underappreciated degree of heterogeneity in the basal cell pool, leading to identification of six subpopulations in the adult murine trachea. Among these, we found two major subpopulations collectively comprising the most uncommitted of all the pool, but with distinct gene expression signatures. Notably, these occupy distinct ventral and dorsal tracheal niches and differ in their ability to self-renew and initiate a program of differentiation in response to environmental perturbations in primary cultures and in mouse injury models in vivo. We found that such heterogeneity is acquired prenatally, when the basal cell pool and local niches are still being established, and depends on the integrity of these niches, as supported by the altered basal cell phenotype of tracheal cartilage-deficient mouse mutants. Lastly, we show that features that distinguish these progenitor subpopulations in murine airways are conserved in humans. Together, the data provide novel insights into the origin and impact of basal cell heterogeneity on the establishment of regionally distinct responses of the airway epithelium during injury-repair and in disease conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neutrophil–B-cell axis impacts tissue damage control in a mouse model of intraabdominal bacterial infection via Cxcr4</a></h4>

              
                Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by uncontrolled systemic inflammation and coagulation, leading to multiorgan failure. Therapeutic options to prevent sepsis-associated immunopathology remain scarce. Here, we established a mouse model of long-lasting disease tolerance during severe sepsis, manifested by diminished immunothrombosis and organ damage in spite of a high pathogen burden. We found that both neutrophils and B cells emerged as key regulators of tissue integrity. Enduring changes in the transcriptional profile of neutrophils include upregulated Cxcr4 expression in protected, tolerant hosts. Neutrophil Cxcr4 upregulation required the presence of B cells, suggesting that B cells promoted disease tolerance by improving tissue damage control via the suppression of neutrophils’ tissue-damaging properties. Finally, therapeutic administration of a Cxcr4 agonist successfully promoted tissue damage control and prevented liver damage during sepsis. Our findings highlight the importance of a critical B-cell/neutrophil interaction during sepsis and establish neutrophil Cxcr4 activation as a potential means to promote disease tolerance during sepsis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of cell size control is canalized towards adders or sizers by cell cycle structure and selective pressures</a></h4>

              
                Cell size is controlled to be within a specific range to support physiological function. To control their size, cells use diverse mechanisms ranging from ‘sizers’, in which differences in cell size are compensated for in a single cell division cycle, to ‘adders’, in which a constant amount of cell growth occurs in each cell cycle. This diversity raises the question why a particular cell would implement one rather than another mechanism? To address this question, we performed a series of simulations evolving cell size control networks. The size control mechanism that evolved was influenced by both cell cycle structure and specific selection pressures. Moreover, evolved networks recapitulated known size control properties of naturally occurring networks.  If the mechanism is based on a G1 size control and an S/G2/M timer, as found for budding yeast and some human cells, adders likely evolve. But, if the G1 phase is significantly longer than the S/G2/M phase, as is often the case in mammalian cells <i>in vivo</i>, sizers become more likely. Sizers also evolve when the cell cycle structure is inverted so that G1 is a timer, while S/G2/M performs size control, as is the case for the fission yeast <i>S. pombe</i>. For some size control networks, cell size consistently decreases in each cycle until a burst of cell cycle inhibitor drives an extended G1 phase much like the cell division cycle of the green algae <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. That these size control networks evolved such self-organized criticality shows how the evolution of complex systems can drive the emergence of critical processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein evidence of unannotated ORFs in Drosophila reveals diversity in the evolution and properties of young proteins</a></h4>

              
                <i>De novo</i> gene origination, where a previously non-genic genomic sequence becomes genic through evolution, has been increasingly recognized as an important source of evolutionary novelty across diverse taxa. Many <i>de novo</i> genes have been proposed to be protein-coding, and in several cases have been experimentally shown to yield protein products. However, the systematic study of <i>de novo</i> proteins has been hampered by doubts regarding the translation of their transcripts without the experimental observation of protein products. Using a systematic, ORF-focused mass-spectrometry-first computational approach, we identify almost 1000 unannotated open reading frames with evidence of translation (utORFs) in the model organism <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, 371 of which have canonical start codons. To quantify the comparative genomic similarity of these utORFs across <i>Drosophila</i> and to infer phylostratigraphic age, we further develop a synteny-based protein similarity approach. Combining these results with reference datasets on tissue- and life-stage-specific transcription and conservation, we identify different properties amongst these utORFs. Contrary to expectations, the fastest-evolving utORFs are not the youngest evolutionarily. We observed more utORFs in the brain than in the testis. Most of the identified utORFs may be of <i>de novo</i> origin, even accounting for the possibility of false-negative similarity detection. Finally, sequence divergence after an inferred <i>de novo</i> origin event remains substantial, raising the possibility that <i>de novo</i> proteins turn over frequently. Our results suggest that there is substantial unappreciated diversity in <i>de novo</i> protein evolution: many more may exist than have been previously appreciated; there may be divergent evolutionary trajectories; and <i>de novo</i> proteins may be gained and lost frequently. All in all, there may not exist a single characteristic model of <i>de novo</i> protein evolution, but instead, there may be diverse evolutionary trajectories for <i>de novo</i> proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Harmonic memory signals in the human cerebral cortex induced by sematic relatedness of words</a></h4>

              
                When we memorize multiple words simultaneously, semantic relatedness among those words assists memory. For example, the information of 'apple', 'banana' and 'orange' will be connected via a common concept of 'fruits' and become easy to retain and recall. Neural mechanisms underlying this semantic integration in verbal working memory remain unclear. Here I used electroencephalography (EEG) and investigated neural signals when healthy human participants memorized five nouns semantically related (Sem trial) or not (NonSem trial). The regularity of oscillatory signals (8 to 30 Hz) during the retention period was found to be lower in NonSem than Sem trials, indicating that memorizing words unrelated to each other induced a non-harmonic (irregular) waveform in the temporal cortex. These results suggest that (i) semantic features of a word are retained as a set of neural oscillations at specific frequencies and (ii) memorizing words sharing a common semantic feature produces harmonic brain responses through a resonance or integration (sharing) of the oscillatory signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interpretable brain decoding from sensations to cognition to action: graph neural networks reveal the representational hierarchy of human cognition</a></h4>

              
                Inter-subject modeling of cognitive processes has been a challenging task due to large individual variability in brain structure and function. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a potential way to project subject-specific neural responses onto a common representational space by effectively combining local and distributed brain activity through connectome-based constraints. Here we provide in-depth interpretations of biologically-constrained GNNs (BGNNs) that reach state-of-the-art performance in several decoding tasks and reveal inter-subject aligned neural representations underpinning cognitive processes. Specifically, the model not only segregates brain responses at different stages of cognitive tasks, e.g. motor preparation and motor execution, but also uncovers functional gradients in neural representations, e.g. a gradual progression of visual working memory (VWM) from sensory processing to cognitive control and towards behavioral abstraction. Moreover, the multilevel representations of VWM exhibit better inter-subject alignment in brain responses, higher decoding of cognitive states, and strong phenotypic and genetic correlations with individual behavioral performance. Our work demonstrates that biologically constrained deep-learning models have the potential towards both cognitive and biological fidelity in cognitive modeling, and open new avenues to interpretable functional gradients of brain cognition in a wide range of cognitive neuroscience questions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural representations of the content and production of human vocalization</a></h4>

              
                Speech, as the spoken form of language, is fundamental for human communication. The phenomenon of covert inner speech implies a functional independence of speech content and motor production. However, it remains unclear how a flexible mapping between speech content and production is achieved on the neural level. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans performing a rule-based vocalization task. On each trial, vocalization content (one of two vowels) and production form (overt or covert) were instructed independently. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found robust neural information about vocalization content and production, mostly originating from speech areas of the left hemisphere. Production signals dynamically transformed upon presentation of the content cue, whereas content signals remained largely stable throughout the trial. In sum, our results show dissociable neural representations of vocalization content and production in the human brain and provide new insights into the neural dynamics underlying human vocalization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Attentional inhibition ability predicts neural representation during challenging auditory streaming</a></h4>

              
                Focusing on a single source within a complex auditory scene is challenging. M/EEG-based auditory attention detection allows to detect which stream, within a set of multiple concurrent streams, an individual is attending to. The high inter-individual variability in the AAD performance is most often attributed to physiological factors and signal to noise ratio of neural data. Here we address the hypothesis that cognitive factors and in particular sustained attention, WM and attentional inhibition, may also partly explain the variability in AAD performance, because they support the cognitive processes required when listening to complex auditory scenes. Here, we chose a particularly challenging auditory scene, by presenting dichotically polyphonic classical piano excerpts lasting one minute each. Two different excerpts were presented simultaneously in each ear. Forty-one participants, with different degrees of musical expertise, listened to these complex auditory scenes focussing on one ear while we recorded the EEG. Participants also completed several tasks assessing executive functions. As expected, attended stimuli were better decoded than unattended stimuli. Importantly, attentional inhibition ability did explain around 10% of the reconstruction accuracy and around 8% of the classification accuracy. No other cognitive function was a significant predictor of reconstruction or of classification accuracies. No clear effect of musical expertise was found on reconstruction and classification performances. In conclusion, cognitive factors seem to impact the robustness of the auditory representation and hence the performance of neural based decoding approaches. Taking advantage of this relation could be useful to improve next-generation hearing aids.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accelerated signal propagation speed in human neocortical microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Human-specific cognitive abilities depend on information processing in the cerebral cortex, where neurons are significantly larger and sparser compared to rodents. We found that, in synaptically-connected layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (L2/3 PCs), soma-to-soma signal propagation delay is similar in humans and rodents. Thus, to compensate for the increase in neurons size, membrane potential changes must propagate faster in human axons and/or dendrites. Dual somato-dendritic and somato-axonal patch recordings show that action potentials (APs) propagation speed is similar in human and rat axons, but the forward propagation of the EPSPs and the back-propagating APs are ~1.7-fold faster in human dendrites. Faithful biophysical models of human and rat L2/3 PCs, combined with pharmacological manipulations of membrane properties, showed that the larger dendritic diameter, combined with differences in cable properties, underlie the accelerated signal propagation in human cortical circuits. The implication for information processing in the human brain are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">More than half of the variance in in-vivo 1H-MRS metabolite estimates is common to all metabolites</a></h4>

              
                The present study characterized associations among brain metabolite levels, applying bivariate and multivariate (i.e., factor analysis) statistical methods to tCr-referenced estimates of the major PRESS 1H-MRS metabolites (i.e., tNAA/tCr, tCho/tCr, mI/tCr, Glx/tCr), acquired from medial parietal lobe in a large (n=299), well-characterized international cohort of healthy volunteers (Povazan et al., 2020). Results supported the hypothesis that 1H-MRS-measured metabolite estimates are moderately intercorrelated (Mr = 0.42, SDr = 0.11, ps < 0.001), with more than half (i.e., 57%) of the total variability in metabolite estimates common to (i.e., shared by) all metabolites. Older age was significantly associated with lower levels of common metabolite variance (CMV; {beta} = -0.09, p = 0.048), despite not being associated with levels of any individual metabolite. Holding CMV levels constant, females had significantly lower levels of total choline (i.e., unique metabolite variance or UMV; {beta} = -0.19, p < 0.001), mirroring significant bivariate correlations between sex and total choline reported previously. If replicated, these results would suggest that applied 1H-MRS researchers should shift their analytical framework from examining bivariate associations between individual metabolites and specialty-dependent (e.g., clinical, research) variables of interest (e.g., using t-tests) to examining multi-variable (i.e., covariate) associations between multiple metabolites and specialty-dependent variables of interest (e.g., using multiple regression). Without this shift, clear interpretation of associations of 1H-MRS metabolites with specialty-dependent variables of interest may not be possible.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accurate measurement of inhibition and excitation in human motor pools during sensory stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a pivotal approach in clinical and basic neurophysiology, allowing us to extract the summed activity of motor units in a given muscle. Due to the bipolar nature of the motor unit action potential, the sEMG is a non-linear representation of their underlying motor unit activity and therefore affected by signal cancellation. It is not clear how this signal cancellation influences stimulus evoked responses in sEMG. The aim of our study was to characterise how representative an evoked sEMG response was to the firing behaviour of the underlying motor pool. To do this, we first carried out simulations of a population of motor units (and their action potentials) that responded to a stimulus with a change in firing probability. Their activity was summed then rectified to generate a simulated sEMG signal or was rectified and then summed, to generate a sEMG signal with no cancellation. By comparing the two responses to that of the underlying pool we would then compare for discrepancies and for the contribution of signal cancellation. We repeated this process but by using the responses of tibialis anterior motor units to weak tibial nerve stimulation. We find that both for the simulated and experimental data the response measured through the sEMG is almost always an underestimate of the evoked response in the underlying motor pool. This is the case for both inhibitory and excitatory evoked responses. The magnitude of the inaccuracy depends on the size of the evoked response, but it cannot be accounted solely by signal cancellation, suggesting other factors may also contribute.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of extinction in a rat model of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Extinction is a fundamental form of inhibitory learning that is important for adapting to changing environmental contingencies. While numerous studies have investigated the neural correlates of extinction using Pavlovian fear conditioning and appetitive operant reward-seeking procedures, less is known about the neural circuitry mediating the extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned responding. Here, we aimed to generate an extensive brain activation map of extinction learning in a rat model of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning. Male Long-Evans rats were trained to associate a conditioned stimulus (CS; 20 s white noise) with the delivery of a 10% sucrose unconditioned stimulus (US; 0.3 ml/CS) to a fluid port. Control groups also received CS presentations, but sucrose was delivered either during the inter-trial interval or in the home-cage. After conditioning, 1 or 6 extinction sessions were conducted in which the CS was presented but sucrose was withheld. We performed Fos immunohistochemistry and network connectivity analyses on a set of cortical, striatal, thalamic, and amygdalar brain regions. Neural activity in the prelimbic cortex, ventral orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core, and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus was greater during recall relative to extinction. Conversely, prolonged extinction following 6 sessions induced increased neural activity in the infralimbic cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens shell compared to home-cage controls. All these structures were similarly recruited during recall on the first extinction session. These findings provide novel evidence for the contribution of brain areas and neural networks that are differentially involved in the recall versus extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned responding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Voxel-Wise Brain Graphs from Diffusion MRI: Intrinsic Eigenspace Dimensionality and Application to fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Structural brain graphs are conventionally limited to defining nodes as gray matter regions from an atlas, with edges reflecting the density of axonal projections between pairs of nodes. Here we explicitly model the entire set of voxels within a brain mask as nodes of high-resolution, subject-specific graphs. We define the strength of local voxel-to-voxel connections using diffusion tensors and orientation distribution functions derived from diffusion-weighted MRI data. We study the graphs' Laplacian spectral properties on data from the Human Connectome Project. We then assess the extent of inter-subject variability of the Laplacian eigenmodes via a procrustes validation scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the extent to which functional MRI data are shaped by the underlying anatomical structure via graph signal processing. The graph Laplacian eigenmodes manifest highly resolved spatial profiles, reflecting distributed patterns that correspond to major white matter pathways. We show that the intrinsic dimensionality of the eigenspace of such high-resolution graphs is only a mere fraction of the graph dimensions. By projecting task and resting-state data on low-frequency graph Laplacian eigenmodes, we show, firstly, that brain activity can be well approximated by a small subset of low-frequency components, and secondly, that spectral graph energy profiles differ under different functional loads. The proposed graphs open new avenues in studying the brain, be it, by exploring their organisational properties via graph or spectral graph theory, or by treating them as the scaffold on which brain function is observed at the individual level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding of the speech envelope from EEG using the VLAAI deep neural network.</a></h4>

              
                To investigate the processing of speech in the brain, commonly simple linear models are used to establish a relationship between brain signals and speech features. However, these linear models are ill-equipped to model a highly-dynamic, complex non-linear system like the brain, and they often require a substantial amount of subject-specific training data. This work introduces a novel speech decoder architecture: the Very Large Augmented Auditory Inference (VLAAI) network. The VLAAI network outperformed state-of-the-art subject-independent models (median Pearson correlation of 0.19, p < 0.001), yielding an increase over the well-established linear model by 52%. Using ablation techniques we identified the relative importance of each part of the VLAAI network and found that the non-linear components and output context module influenced model performance the most (10% relative performance increase). Subsequently, the VLAAI network was evaluated on a holdout dataset of 26 subjects and publicly available unseen dataset to test generalization for unseen subjects and stimuli. No significant difference was found between the holdout subjects and the default test set, and only a small difference between the default test set and the public dataset was found. Compared to the baseline models, the VLAAI network still significantly outperformed all baseline models on the public dataset. We evaluated the effect of training set size by training the VLAAI network on data from 1 up to 80 subjects and evaluated on 26 holdout subjects, revealing a logarithmic relationship between the number of subjects in the training set and the performance on unseen subjects. Finally, the subject-independent VLAAI network was fine-tuned for 26 holdout subjects to obtain subject-specific VLAAI models. With 5 minutes of data or more, a significant performance improvement was found, up to 34% (from 0.18 to 0.25 median Pearson correlation) with regards to the subject-independent VLAAI network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MicroRNA-335-5p suppresses voltage-gated sodium channel expression and may be a target for seizure control</a></h4>

              
                There remains an urgent need for new therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Sodium channel blockers are effective for seizure control in common forms of epilepsy, but loss of sodium channel function underlies some genetic forms of epilepsy. Approaches that provide bi-directional control of sodium channel expression are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs which negatively regulate gene expression. Here, we show that genome-wide miRNA screening of hippocampal tissue from a rat epilepsy model, mice treated with the novel anti-seizure medicine cannabidiol (CBD) and plasma from patients with DRE, converge on a single target, miR-335-5p. Pathway analysis on predicted and validated miR-335-5p targets identified multiple voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). Intracerebroventricular injection of antisense oligonucleotides against miR-335-5p resulted in upregulation of Scn1a, Scn2a and Scn3a in the mouse brain and an increased action potential rising phase and greater excitability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in brain slice recordings, consistent with VGSCs as functional targets of miR-335-5p. Blocking of miR-335-5p also increased voltage-gated sodium currents in human iPSC-derived neurons. Inhibition of miR-335-5p increased susceptibility to tonic-clonic seizures in the pentylenetetrazole seizure model, whereas AAV9-mediated overexpression of miR-335-5p reduced seizure severity and improved survival. These studies suggest modulation of miR-335-5p may be a means to regulate VGSCs and affect brain excitability and seizures. Changes to miR-335-5p may reflect compensatory mechanisms to control excitability and could provide new biomarker or therapeutic strategies for different types of drug-resistant epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine regulates decision thresholds in human reinforcement learning.</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine fundamentally contributes to reinforcement learning by encoding predictions errors, deviations of an outcome from expectation. Prediction error coding in dopaminergic regions in human functional neuroimaging studies is well replicated. In contrast, replications of behavioral and neural effects of pharmacological modulations of the dopamine system in human reinforcement learning are scarce. Additionally, dopamine contributes to action selection, but direct evidence and process-specific accounts in human reinforcement learning are lacking. Here we examined dopaminergic mechanisms underlying human reinforcement learning in a within-subjects pharmacological approach in male human volunteers (n=31, within-subjects design; Placebo, 150mg L-dopa, 2mg Haloperidol) in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging and a stationary reinforcement learning task. We had two aims. First, we aimed to replicate previously reported beneficial effects of L-dopa vs. Haloperidol on reinforcement learning from gains. This replication was not successful. We observed no performance benefit of L-Dopa vs. Haloperidol, and no evidence for alterations in neural prediction error signaling. In contrast, Bayesian analyses provided moderate evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. This unsuccessful replication is likely at least partly due to a number of differences in experimental design. Second, using combined reinforcement learning drift diffusion models, we tested the recent proposal that dopamine contributes to action selection by regulating decision thresholds. Model comparison revealed that the data were best accounted for by a reinforcement learning drift diffusion model with separate learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors. The model accounted for both reductions in RTs and increases in accuracy over the course of learning. The only parameter showing robust drug effects was the boundary separation parameter, which revealed reduced decision thresholds under both L-Dopa and Haloperidol, compared to Placebo, and the degree of threshold reduction accounted for individual differences in RTs between conditions. Results are in line with the idea that striatal dopamine regulates decision thresholds during action selection, and that lower dosages of D2 receptor antagonists increase striatal DA release via an inhibition of autoreceptor-mediated feedback mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phosphatidylserine controls synaptic targeting and membrane stability of ASIC1a</a></h4>

              
                Phospholipid-protein interaction is highly specialized at the membranous nanodomains and critical for membrane receptor signaling. Calcium-permeable acid-sensing ion channel isoform 1a (ASIC1a) is a major neuronal proton sensor that contributes to synaptic plasticity. The functional outcome of ASIC1a is dependent on its surface targeting in synaptic subdomains; however, the lipid environment for ASIC1a and its role in channel targeting remain poorly understood. Here, we report that anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) is enriched in dendritic spines during neurodevelopment and it directly binds to ASIC1a through an electrostatic interaction with a di-arginine motif at ASIC1a C-terminus. PS regulates the membrane targeting and function of ASIC1a, which are both strongly suppressed by inhibition of PS synthesis. In cortical neuron dendrites, both PS and ASIC1a are predominately localized to peri-synaptic sites of spine heads, surrounding instead of overlapping with postsynaptic markers, PSD-95 and GluN1. Uncoupling the interaction between PS and ASIC1a by changing the charges to neutral or acidic at the di-arginine PS-binding motif, or applying a membrane penetrating competing peptide, caused mistargeting of ASIC1a at the synaptic sites, an overall increase in internalization and/or cytoplasmic accumulation of ASIC1a, and a decrease in its channel function. Together, our results provide novel insights on lipid microenvironment that governs ASIC1a expression and function at the membrane surface, especially peri-synaptic regions of dendritic spines, through an electrostatic interaction with anionic phospholipids.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Macaque amygdala, claustrum and pulvinar support the cross-modal association of social audio-visual stimuli based on meaning</a></h4>

              
                Social communication draws on several cognitive functions such as perception, emotion recognition and attention. In a previous study, we demonstrated that macaques associate audio-visual information when processing their species-specific communicative signals. Specifically, cortical activation is inhibited when there is a mismatch between vocalisations and social visual information whereas activation is enhanced in the lateral sulcus, superior temporal sulcus as well as a larger network composed of early visual and prefrontal areas when vocalisations and social visual information match. Here, we use a similar task and functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the role of subcortical structures. We identify three subcortical regions involved in audio-visual processing of species-specific communicative signal: the amygdala, the claustrum and the pulvinar. Like the cortex, these subcortical structures are not activated when there is a mismatch between visual and acoustic information. In contrast, the amygdala and claustrum are activated by visual, auditory congruent and audio-visual stimulations. The pulvinar responds in a task-dependent manner, along a specific spatial sensory gradient. Anterior pulvinar responds to auditory stimuli, medial pulvinar is activated by auditory, audio-visual and visual stimuli and the dorsal lateral pulvinar only responds to visual stimuli in a pure visual task. The medial pulvinar and the amygdala are the only subcortical structures integrating audio-visual social stimuli. We propose that these three structures belong to a multisensory network that modulates the perception of visual socioemotional information and vocalizations as a function of the relevance of the stimuli in the social context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Apolipoprotein E4 modulates astrocyte neuronal support functions in the presence of amyloid-β</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a lipid transporter produced predominantly by astrocytes in the brain. The {epsilon}4 variant of APOE (APOE4) is the strongest and most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). Although the molecular mechanisms of this increased risk are unclear, APOE4 is known to alter immune signaling and lipid and glucose metabolism. Astrocytes provide various forms of support to neurons, including regulating neuron metabolism and immune responses through cytokine signaling. Changes in astrocyte function due to APOE4 may therefore decrease neuronal support, leaving neurons more vulnerable to stress and disease insults. To determine whether APOE4 alters astrocyte neuronal support functions, we measured glycolytic and oxidative metabolism of neurons treated with conditioned media from APOE4 or APOE3 (the common, risk-neutral variant) primary astrocyte cultures. We found that APOE4 neurons treated with conditioned media from resting APOE4 astrocytes had similar metabolism to APOE3 astrocytes, but treatment with ACM from astrocytes challenged with amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), a key pathological protein in AD, caused APOE4 neurons to increase their basal mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolic rates more than APOE3 neurons. These changes were not due to differences in astrocytic lactate production or glucose utilization, but instead correlated with increased glycolytic ATP production and a lack of cytokine secretion response to A{beta}. Together, these findings suggest that in the presence of A{beta}, APOE4 astrocytes alter immune and metabolic functions that result in a compensatory increase in neuronal metabolic stress.

                Adult mammalian spinal cord stops re-entering sensory axons, resulting in incurable sensory loss after dorsal root injury. Challenging the prevailing view, we previously showed that axons rapidly stop by forming synaptic, not dystrophic endings, and that myelin inhibitors and CSPGs are not the primary mechanism arresting axons. Here, we report that in adult mice dystrophic endings are formed by occasional axons embedded in fibrous collagens, exclusively at the CNS:PNS boundary where oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs, or NG2 glia) are sparse. Most axons stop beyond the boundary in extensive contacts with OPC processes. Live imaging, immuno-EM and OPC-DRG co-culture show that axonal synapses form on OPCs. Genetic OPC ablation, although incomplete, enables many axons to continue regenerating deep into the spinal cord. These data, together with earlier findings, conclusively demonstrate that axons stop largely because OPCs stimulate presynaptic differentiation. We identify OPCs as a major regenerative barrier at the CNS:PNS border.

                Identifying white matter (WM) microstructure parameters that reflect the underlying biology of the brain will advance our understanding of ageing and brain health. In this extensive comparison of brain age predictions and age-associations of WM features from different diffusion approaches, we analysed UK Biobank diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data across midlife and older age (N = 35,749, 44.6 to 82.8 years of age). Conventional and advanced dMRI approaches were consistent in predicting brain age; with their WM-features similarly related to and predicted by age. However, brain age was estimated best when combining approaches, showing different aspects of WM to contribute to brain age. Fornix was found as the central region for brain age predictions across diffusion approaches. We encourage the application of multiple dMRI approaches for detailed insights into WM, and the further investigation of fornix as a potential biomarker of brain age and ageing.

                Brain states are frequently represented using a unidimensional scale measuring the richness of subjective experience (level of consciousness). This description assumes a mapping between the high-dimensional space of whole-brain configurations and the trajectories of brain states associated with changes in consciousness, yet this mapping and its properties remain unknown. We combined whole-brain modelling, data augmentation and deep learning for dimensionality reduction to determine a mapping representing states of consciousness in a low-dimensional space, where distances parallel similarities between states. An orderly trajectory from wakefulness to brain injured patients is revealed in a latent space whose coordinates represent metrics related to functional modularity and structure-function coupling, both increasing alongside loss of consciousness. Finally, we investigated the effects of model perturbations, providing geometrical interpretation for the stability and reversibility of states. We conclude that conscious awareness depends on functional patterns encoded as a low-dimensional trajectory within the vast space of brain configurations.

                Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by alternating manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes, with rare reports on the mechanism of manic/depressive behavior switching. Our study revealed that knockdown of Per2 in the hippocampal CA1 brain region induced manic-like behavior in rats, in contrast, over-expression of the Per2 gene in the same brain region results in depression-like behavior, indicating that Per2 mediates the manic/depressive phenotype switch. It is known that pCREB is the transcription factor of Per2. We found that pCREB regulates the expression of Per2 and pCREB-Per2 pathway mediates the manic/depressive behavioral switch. This provides a novel animal model of bipolar disorder, which may be the first animal model that presents both mania and depression-like behaviors,and may promote the progress of research into bipolar disorder.

                Cortical state is modulated by myriad cognitive and physiological mechanisms. Yet it is still unclear how changes in cortical state relate to changes in neuronal processing. Previous studies have reported state dependent changes in response gain or population-wide shared variability, motivated by the fact that both are important determinants of the performance of any population code. However, if the state-conditioned cortical regime is well-captured by a linear input-output response (as is often the case), then the linear Fisher information (FI) about a stimulus available to a decoder is invariant to state changes. In this study we show that by contrast, when one restricts a decoder to a subset of a cortical population, information within the subpopulation can increase through a modulation of cortical state. A clear example of such a subpopulation code is one in which decoders only receive projections from excitatory cells in a recurrent excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) network. We demonstrate the counterintuitive fact that when decoding only from E cells, it is exclusively the I cell response gain and connectivity which govern how information changes. Additionally, we propose a parametrically simplified approach to studying the effect of state change on subpopulation codes. Our results reveal the importance of inhibitory circuitry in modulating information flow in recurrent cortical networks, and establish a framework in which to develop deeper mechanistic insight into the impact of cortical state changes on information processing in these circuits.

                Finding reliable imaging biomarkers of mental illness has been a major challenge, on a par with the quest for biomarkers of the male versus the female brain, as the two types of imaging inform one another. We explored the hypothesis that the degree of coherence (internal isomorphism) between brain volumes of the left versus the right hemisphere for patients with psychopathological conditions follows the brain coherence pattern of the healthy male or healthy female. We developed the distance index (DI) as a biomarker of brain coherence and compared it with three ad hoc coherence measures. We found that only DI could reliably distinguish males from females and patients from controls. Also, cortical regions with highest DI scores were swapped between males and females across groups following male/female models of psychopathology. Furthermore, although indices were similar in predicting cognitive performance, DI provided a more proportionate prediction pattern across diagnosis groups, and more robust interactions with males/females. These findings highlight the importance of brain coherence, particularly measured by DI, for phenotyping sex and mental illness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The BeMoBIL Pipeline for automated analyses of multimodal mobile brain and body imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Advancements in hardware technology and analysis methods allow more and more mobility in electroencephalography (EEG) experiments. Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) studies may record various types of data such as motion or eye tracking in addition to neural activity. Although there are options available to analyze EEG data in a standardized way, they do not fully cover complex multimodal data from mobile experiments. We thus propose the BeMoBIL Pipeline, an easy-to-use pipeline in MATLAB that supports the time-synchronized handling of multimodal data. It is based on EEGLAB and fieldtrip and consists of automated functions for EEG preprocessing and subsequent source separation. It also provides functions for motion data processing and extraction of event markers from different data modalities, including the extraction of events from EEG using independent component analysis. The pipeline introduces a new robust method for region-of-interest-based group-level clustering of independent EEG components. Finally, the BeMoBIL Pipeline provides analytical visualizations at various processing steps, keeping the analysis transparent and allowing for quality checks of the resulting outcomes. All parameters and steps are documented within the data structure and can be fully replicated using the same scripts. This pipeline makes the processing and analysis of (mobile) EEG and body data more reliable and independent of the prior experience of the individual researchers, thus facilitating the use of EEG in general and MoBI in particular. It is an open-source project available for download at https://github.com/BeMoBIL/bemobil-pipeline which allows for community-driven adaptations in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fluorescence lifetime enables high-resolution analysis of neuromodulator dynamics across time and animals</a></h4>

              
                Optical sensors have transformed the field of neuromodulation because neuromodulator dynamics are essential for their function. Despite their high spatial and temporal resolution, these fluorescence intensity-based sensors are sensitive to sensor expression level and excitation light fluctuation, thus preventing analysis of neuromodulators across time or animals. Here, we screened neuromodulator sensors and discovered that multiple sensors showed response in fluorescence lifetime, a property independent of sensor expression or excitation light power. The acetylcholine sensor GRAB-ACh3.0 showed the largest lifetime change. Fluorescence lifetime of GRAB-ACh3.0 responds to transient ACh release, is dose sensitive, and is insensitive to excitation laser power. In mice across sleep/wake and running/resting states, fluorescence lifetime, in contrast to intensity, predicts behavior states accurately despite change in sensor expression level across weeks and animals. Thus, fluorescence lifetime of neuromodulator sensors enables comparison of neuromodulator dynamics at high resolution across different animals, brain regions, disease models, and chronic time scales.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Examination of Onset Trajectories and Persistence of Binge-Like Eating Behavior in Mice after Intermittent Palatable Food Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Binge eating (BE) is a persistent behavior associated with a chronic course of illness and poor treatment outcomes. While clinical research is unable to capture the full course of BE, pre-clinical approaches offer the opportunity to examine binge-like eating from onset through chronic durations, allowing identification of factors contributing to BE persistence. The current study quantified the trajectories of binge-like eating onset and modeled cycles of abstinence/relapse to develop a translational model for BE persistence. Adult male and female C57Bl6/J mice were randomized to a binge-like palatable food (PF) access schedule (daily 2-hour, 3x/week) or continuous, non-binge like PF access for 12 days (Experiment 1). Persistence of PF consumption in both binge-like PF access groups was then examined across three cycles of forced abstinence and re-exposure to PF (incubation) to model the persistence of BE in clinical populations. Mice with daily 2 hour PF access escalated their intake more than mice in the 3x/week or continuous groups (Experiment 1). This pattern was more pronounced in females. In addition, this pattern of PF intake re-emerged across multiple cycles of behavioral incubation (Experiment 2). These findings provide a model of binge-like eating in mice that can be used in future studies examining both environmental factors and neural mechanisms contributing to BE persistence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">kcna1a mutant zebrafish as a model of episodic ataxia type 1 and epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Objective: KCNA1 mutations are associated with a rare neurological movement disorder known as episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), with epilepsy as a common comorbidity. Current medications only provide partial relief to ataxia and/or seizures, making new drugs needed. Here, we investigate the utility of zebrafish kcna1a-/- as a model of EA1 with epilepsy by characterizing its phenotype and comparing the efficacy of the first-line therapy carbamazepine in kcna1a-/- zebrafish to Kcna1-/- rodents. Methods: We used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to introduce a mutation in the sixth segment of the zebrafish Kcna1 protein. Behavioral and electrophysiological assays were performed on kcna1a-/- larvae to assess ataxia- and epilepsy-related phenotypes. We also carried out real-time qPCRs to measure the transcript levels of brain hyperexcitability markers and bioenergetic profiling of kcna1a-/- larvae to evaluate their metabolic health. Carbamazepine efficacy was tested using behavioral assessments in kcna1a-/- zebrafish and seizure frequency in Kcna1-/- mice. Results: kcna1a-/- zebrafish showed uncoordinated movements and locomotor deficits. The mutants also exhibited impaired startle responses when exposed to light-dark flashes and acoustic stimulation. Extracellular field recordings and upregulated fosab transcript levels showed hyperexcitability of the kcna1a-/- brain. Further, vglut2a and gad1b transcript levels were altered, indicative of neuronal excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in the kcna1a-/- brain. Metabolic health was also compromised in kcna1a-/- as seen by a significant reduction in measures of cellular respiration. Notably, carbamazepine reduced the impaired startle response in kcna1a-/- zebrafish but had no effect on the seizure frequency in Kcna1-/- mice, suggesting that this EA1 zebrafish model might better translate to human efficacy compared to rodents. Significance: We conclude that zebrafish kcna1a-/- larvae show ataxia and epilepsy-related phenotypes and that they are responsive to carbamazepine treatment, consistent with EA1 patients. This study supports the notion that these zebrafish disease models can be useful for drug screening as well as studying the underlying disease biology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accurate Bayesian segmentation of thalamic nuclei using diffusion MRI and an improved histological atlas</a></h4>

              
                The human thalamus is a highly connected brain structure, which is key for the control of numerous functions and is involved in several neurological disorders. Recently, neuroimaging studies have increasingly focused on the volume and connectivity of the specific nuclei comprising this structure, rather than looking at the thalamus as a whole. However, accurate identification of cytoarchitectonically designed histological nuclei on standard in vivo structural MRI is hampered by the lack of image contrast that can be used to distinguish nuclei from each other and from surrounding white matter tracts. While diffusion MRI may offer such contrast, it has lower resolution and lacks some boundaries visible in structural imaging. In this work, we present a Bayesian segmentation algorithm for the thalamus. This algorithm combines prior information from a probabilistic atlas with likelihood models for both structural and diffusion MRI, allowing label boundaries to be informed by both modalities. We present an improved probabilistic atlas, incorporating 26 thalamic nuclei identified from histology and 45 white matter tracts identified in ultra-high gradient strength diffusion imaging. We present a family of likelihood models for diffusion tensor imaging, ensuring compatibility with the vast majority of neuroimaging datasets that include diffusion MRI data. The use of these diffusion likelihood models greatly improves identification of nuclei versus segmentation based solely on structural MRI. Dice comparison of 5 manually identifiable groups of nuclei to ground truth segmentations show improvements of up to 10 percentage points. Additionally, our chosen model shows a high degree of reliability, with median test-retest Dice scores above 0.85 for four out of five nuclei groups, whilst also offering improved detection of differential thalamic involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AUROC 83.36%). The probabilistic atlas and segmentation tool will be made publicly available as part of the neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Value-Based Neural Representations Predict Social Decision Preferences</a></h4>

              
                Social decision-making is omnipresent in everyday life, carrying the potential for both positive and negative consequences for the decision-maker and those closest to them. While evidence suggests that decision makers use value-based heuristics to guide choice behavior, very little is known about how decision makers' representations of other agents influence social choice behavior. We used multivariate pattern expression analyses on fMRI data to understand how value-based processes shape neural representations of those affected by one's social decisions and whether value-based encoding is associated with social decision preferences. We found that stronger value-based encoding of a given close other (e.g., parent) relative to a second close other (e.g., friend) was associated with a greater propensity to favor the former during subsequent social decision-making. These results are the first to our knowledge to explicitly show that value-based processes affect decision behavior via representations of close others.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Simple Model of Cortical Intraregional Metastability</a></h4>

              
                Transient synchronization of bursting activity in neural networks, which occurs in patterns of metastable phase relationships between neurons, is a notable feature of network dynamics observed in vivo. However, the mechanisms that contribute to this dynamical complexity in neural circuits are not well understood. Local circuits in cortical regions consist of populations of neurons with diverse intrinsic oscillatory features. In this study, we numerically show that the phenomenon of transient synchronization, also referred to as metastability, emerges in an inhibitory neural population when the neurons' intrinsic fast-spiking dynamics are appropriately modulated by slower inputs from an excitatory neural population. Using a compact model of a mesoscopic-scale network consisting of excitatory pyramidal and inhibitory fast-spiking neurons, our work demonstrates a relationship between the frequency of neural oscillations and the features of emergent metastability. In addition, a novel metric is formulated to characterize collective transitions in metastable networks. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our compact representation of mesoscopic network metastability in modeling whole-brain resting-state dynamics using empirically estimated anatomical connectivity.

	<p>Metabolic syndrome encompasses a spectrum of conditions that increases the risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. It is widely accepted that the sex hormone estrogen plays a protective metabolic role in premenopausal women, in part through central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms. However, most work to date has focused on the loss of estrogen in females (e.g., menopause). Interestingly, transgender individuals receiving feminizing gender affirming therapy (i.e., estrogen) are relatively protected from metabolic syndrome conditions, pointing to a role for CNS estrogen in the development of metabolic syndrome in men. Here, we show that estrogen signaling in the brain protects males from metabolic syndrome and obesity related complications. First, short-term CNS specific supplementation of low-dose 17-&amp;amp;beta;-estradiol in diet-induced obese male mice resulted in a significant reduction in body weight in parallel with a decrease in food intake without alterations in energy expenditure. In conjunction, central supplementation of estrogen reduced visceral adiposity, including epididymal and abdominal regions, with slighter decreases in subcutaneous inguinal and thermogenic brown adipose tissue. Furthermore, central estrogen administration reduced the liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome including hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis. Collectively, these findings indicate that a lack of estrogen action in the brain may predispose males to metabolic syndrome pathogenesis.</p>

	<p>Background: Chronic pain and body perception disturbance are common following stroke. It is possible that an interaction exists between pain and body perception disturbance, and that a change in one may influence the other. We therefore investigated the presence of body perception disturbance in individuals with stroke, aiming to determine if a perceived change in hand size contralateral to the stroke lesion is more common in those with chronic pain than in those without. Methods: Stroke survivors (N = 523) completed an online survey that included: stroke details, pain features, and any difference in perceived hand size post-stroke. Results: Individuals with stroke who experienced chronic pain were almost three times as likely as those without chronic pain to perceive their hand as now being a different size (OR = 2.895; 95%CI 1.844, 4.547). Further, those with chronic pain whose pain included the hand were almost twice as likely to perceive altered hand size than those whose pain did not include the hand (OR = 1.862; 95%CI 1.170, 2.962). This was not influenced by hemisphere of lesion (p = 0.190). Conclusions: The results point to a new characteristic of chronic pain in stroke, raising the possibility of body perception disturbance being a rehabilitation target to improve function and pain-related outcomes for stroke survivors.</p>

	<p>A potential relationship between unrestricted sucrose intake (USI), overweight, and emotional/behavioral control has not been well documented. We examined the influence of USI and having less sweetness than expected on body weight (BW), motor/exploratory, anxiety-like, and social dominant behavior in adult C57BL/6J male mice. Animals had free access to water (group 1) or 32% sucrose and water (sucrose groups 2&amp;amp;ndash;5) for 10 days. Then, group 2 remained with 32% sucrose while groups 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 were subjected to the downshift (24 h access to 4%, 8%, or 16% sucrose). All experimental groups were weighed and tested in the novel-open arena (NA), elevated plus maze (EPM), and tube tests to assess BW, motor/exploratory, anxiety-like, and social dominance behavior, respectively. USI did not influence animals&amp;amp;rsquo; BW but produced hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behavior, which was evident in EPM but not in NA; the outcomes of the downshift were comparable. USI did not influence successes/wins in the tube test but altered emotions that drive the winning, favoring a less anxious behavioral phenotype; this was not evident in the downshifted groups. Observed findings suggest that USI promotes sensation-seeking and motivates dominance, without changing BW, while blunted emotional base of social dominance might be an early mark of the downshift.</p>

	<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening condition associated with high mortality and substantial long-term morbidity. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a new pathogen that causes a disease with variable clinical manifestations. Although the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hypercoagulopathy, patients may also present with cerebral hemorrhage, including SAH. The present paper reports a protocol for a scoping review that is aimed to provide a comprehensive report on existing literature by examining data on SAH associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective is to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features of SAH in patients with COVID-19 and to explore the etiology and possible interventions in this pathology. Using appropriate search terms, we will search LitCOVID, the WHO database on COVID-19, and MedRxiv. The inclusion criteria are pre-defined. We will extract the data of eligible studies in standardized forms and will report the results in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We will provide information for clinicians, healthcare providers, and public health specialists.</p>

	<p>Background and Purpose: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) leads to ulceration, noninvasive amputation, and long-term disability. This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for forecasting the probability of DPN in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Methods: From February 2017 to May 2021, 778 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included in this study. We confirmed the diagnosis of DPN according to the Toronto Expert Consensus. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 519) and a validation cohort (n = 259). In the training cohort, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, and a simple nomogram was built using the stepwise method. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis were computed in order to validate the discrimination and clinical value of the nomogram model. Results: About 65.7% and 72.2% of patients were diagnosed with DPN in the training and validation cohorts. We developed a novel nomogram to predict the probability of DPN based on the parameters of age, gender, duration of diabetes, body mass index, uric acid, hemoglobin A1c, and free triiodothyronine. The areas under the curves (AUCs) of the nomogram model were 0.763 in the training cohort and 0.755 in the validation cohort. The calibration plots revealed well-fitted accuracy between the predicted and actual probability in the training and validation cohorts. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical value of the nomogram. In subgroup analysis, the predictive ability of the nomogram model was strong. Conclusions: The nomogram of age, gender, duration of diabetes, body mass index, uric acid, hemoglobin A1c, and free triiodothyronine may assist clinicians with the early identification of DPN in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>

	<p>Excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated through N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) is essential for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. While under pathological states, abnormal NMDAR activation is involved in the occurrence and development of psychiatric disorders, which suggests a directional modulation of NMDAR activity that contributes to the remission and treatment of psychiatric disorders. This review thus focuses on the involvement of NMDARs in the pathophysiological processes of psychiatric mood disorders and analyzes the neuroprotective mechanisms of NMDARs. Firstly, we introduce NMDAR-mediated neural signaling pathways in brain function and mood regulation as well as the pathophysiological mechanisms of NMDARs in emotion-related mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. Then, we provide an in-depth summary of current NMDAR modulators that have the potential to be developed into clinical drugs and their pharmacological research achievements in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Based on these findings, drug-targeting for NMDARs might open up novel territory for the development of therapeutic agents for refractory anxiety and depression.</p>

	<p>Background: The treatment of benign skull base tumors remains challenging. These tumors are often located in close relationship to critical structures. Therefore, radical resection of these tumors can be associated with high morbidity. Multimodal treatment concepts, including controlled partial tumor resection followed by radiosurgery, should be considered. Methods: Adaptive hybrid surgery analysis (AHSA) is an intraoperative tool that has been introduced for the automatic assessment of tumor properties, and virtual real-time radiosurgical treatment simulation and continuous feasibility analysis of adjuvant radiosurgery. The AHSA method (Brainlab&amp;amp;reg;, Munich, Germany) was applied to five patients who underwent partial resection of a benign skull base tumor. Tumor volumetry was obtained on pre- and postoperative MR scans. Organs at risk were, preoperative, automatically delineated with atlas mapping software (Elements&amp;amp;reg; Segmentation Cranial), and adaptations were made if necessary. Results: Five patients with benign skull base lesions underwent planned partial tumor resection in a multimodal therapeutic surgery followed by radiosurgery. The preoperative tumor volumes ranged between 8.52 and 25.2 cm3. The intraoperative residual tumor volume measured with the AHSA&amp;amp;reg; software ranged between 2.13&amp;amp;ndash;12.17 cm3 (25&amp;amp;ndash;52% of the preoperative tumor volume). The intraoperative automatic AHSA plans of the remaining tumor volume suggested, in all five patients, that safe hypofractionated radiation was feasible. Patients were followed for 69.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.04 months, and no complications occurred after the patients were treated with radiation. Conclusions: Intraoperative SRS planning based on volumetric assessments during resection of skull base tumors using AHSA&amp;amp;reg; is feasible and safe. The AHSA method allows the neurosurgeon to continuously evaluate the feasibility of adjuvant radiosurgery while planning and performing a surgical resection. This method supports the treatment strategy of a complementary approach during surgical resection of complex skull base tumors and might contribute to preventing surgical and radiosurgical complications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Improved Manual Annotation of EEG Signals through Convolutional Neural Network Guidance</a></h4>

              
                <p>The development of validated algorithms for automated handling of artifacts is essential for reliable and fast processing of EEG signals. Recently, there have been methodological advances in designing machine-learning algorithms to improve artifact detection of trained professionals who usually meticulously inspect and manually annotate EEG signals. However, validation of these methods is hindered by the lack of a gold standard as data are mostly private and data annotation is time consuming and error prone. In the effort to circumvent these issues, we propose an iterative learning model to speed up and reduce errors of manual annotation of EEG. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train on expert-annotated eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state EEG data from typically developing children (<I>n</I> = 30) and children with neurodevelopmental disorders (<I>n</I> = 141). To overcome the circular reasoning of aiming to develop a new algorithm and benchmarking to a manually-annotated gold standard, we instead aim to improve the gold standard by revising the portion of the data that was incorrectly learned by the network. When blindly presented with the selected signals for re-assessment (23% of the data), the two independent expert-annotators changed the annotation in 25% of the cases. Subsequently, the network was trained on the expert-revised gold standard, which resulted in improved separation between artifacts and nonartifacts as well as an increase in balanced accuracy from 74% to 80% and precision from 59% to 76%. These results show that CNNs are promising to enhance manual annotation of EEG artifacts and can be improved further with better gold-standard data.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Opsin-3 (<I>Opn3</I>, encephalopsin) was the first nonvisual opsin gene discovered in mammals. Since then, several <I>Opn3</I> functions have been described, and in two cases (adipose tissue, smooth muscle) light sensing activity is implicated. In addition to peripheral tissues, <I>Opn3</I> is robustly expressed within the central nervous system, for which it derives its name. Despite this expression, no studies have investigated developmental or adult CNS consequences of <I>Opn3</I> loss-of-function. Here, the behavioral consequences of mice deficient in <I>Opn3</I> were investigated. <I>Opn3</I>-deficient mice perform comparably to wild-type mice in measures of motor coordination, socialization, anxiety-like behavior, and various aspects of learning and memory. However, <I>Opn3</I>-deficient mice have an attenuated acoustic startle reflex (ASR) relative to littermates. This deficit is not because of changes in hearing sensitivity, although Opn3 was shown to be expressed in auditory and vestibular structures, including cochlear outer hair cells. Interestingly, the ASR was not acutely light-dependent and did not vary between daytime and nighttime trials, despite known functions of <I>Opn3</I> in photoreception and circadian gene amplitude. Together, these results demonstrate the first role of <I>Opn3</I> on behavior, although the role of this opsin in the CNS remains largely elusive.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex Contributes to Human Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>This study assesses the involvement in human motor learning, of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9/46v), a somatic region in the middle frontal gyrus. The potential involvement of this cortical area in motor learning is suggested by studies in nonhuman primates which have found anatomic connections between this area and sensorimotor regions in frontal and parietal cortex, and also with basal ganglia output zones. It is likewise suggested by electrophysiological studies which have shown that activity in this region is implicated in somatic sensory memory and is also influenced by reward. We directly tested the hypothesis that area 9/46v is involved in reinforcement-based motor learning in humans. Participants performed reaching movements to a hidden target and received positive feedback when successful. Before the learning task, we applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to disrupt activity in 9/46v in the left or right hemisphere. A control group received sham cTBS. The data showed that cTBS to left 9/46v almost entirely eliminated motor learning, whereas learning was not different from sham stimulation when cTBS was applied to the same zone in the right hemisphere. Additional analyses showed that the basic reward-history-dependent pattern of movements was preserved but more variable following left hemisphere stimulation, which suggests an overall deficit in somatic memory for target location or target directed movement rather than reward processing per se. The results indicate that area 9/46v is part of the human motor learning circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Parents’ perceptions on policies of early childhood care and education programmes in selected states of Malaysia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development proposed global equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all children. The quality of early childhood care and education (ECCE) programs helps shape children’s minds, attitudes and behaviors, and has short and long-term effects on a child, a family and a country. In Malaysia, the government has formulated some policies and laws to protect children’s rights. However, ECCE is facing some challenges. The purpose of this study is to investigate parents’ perceptions of the quality of ECCE programs implemented by Malaysian government. Methods: A mixed method was used to collect data on parents’ perceptions of ECCE policies in selected states in Malaysia. The questionnaires, (P1/POL) from the research project “Development of a Comprehensive and Integrated Model of Quality Malaysian ECCE”, were distributed among 629 respondents who have a child in a preschool, and 22 participants were randomly selected to take part in five focus group interviews Results: The key findings of the study revealed 68% parents were not familiar with ECCE Malaysian government policy, however 84.3% stressed it is important for the government to educate them about ECCE. Thus findings indicated that the majority of parents lack awareness of the ECCE policies and quality of early childhood care and education programs related to the policies remain the issue. While interviewing the focus group ,most of them were not aware of ECCE and pointed out parents are stressing children’s academic learning in particular preschools. Conclusions: It is concluded that parents’ awareness regarding the ECCE program must be part of the policies and needs to improve. It is recommended that the government of Malaysia should supply more information on ECCE policies to parents and focus on policy implementation. Moreover, the quality of ECCE programs should be improved based on the parents’ perceptions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Machine learning-based heart attack prediction: A  symptomatic heart attack prediction method and exploratory analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background; Heart attack prediction is one of the serious causes of morbidity in the world’s population. The clinical data analysis includes a very crucial disease i.e., cardiovascular disease as one of the most important sections for the prediction. Data Science and machine learning (ML) can be very helpful in the prediction of heart attacks in which different risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, diabetes, etc... can be considered. The objective of this study is to optimize the prediction of heart disease using ML. Methods: In this paper, we are presenting a machine learning-based heart attack prediction (ML-HAP) method in which the analysis of different risk factors and prediction for heart attacks is done using ML approaches of Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes and XGBoost. The data of heart disease  symptoms has been collected from the UCI ML Repository and analysis has been performed on the data using ML methods. The focus has been on optimizing the prediction on the basis of different parameters. Results: XGBoost provided the best prediction among the four. The Area under the curve achieved with XGBoost is .94 and Logistic Regression is .92. The prediction with ML models in identifying heart attack symptoms is highly efficient, especially with boosting algorithms. The prediction was done to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the curve. ML models are being trained to perform optimized predictions. Conclusions: This prediction can help clinically in analyzing the risk factors of the disease and interpretation of the patient scenario. Boosting the algorithm provided promising results to predict symptoms of heart disease. It can further be optimized by working further on risk factors associated with this condition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Indoor air quality at the Arab governmental girls’ schools [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A proper and adequate school environment is important for an effective learning process and maintaining the health of the students as they spend most of their time in schools. The physical school environment includes the physical structures; presence of chemicals and biological agents; and the surrounding environment, including air, water, and materials. This study aimed to evaluate the indoor air quality (IAQ) in governmental girls’ schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods: Seventeen girls’ schools were randomly selected in the Eastern Province of KSA. The indoor levels of PM10 and PM2.5, volatile organic compounds, CO, NO2, and CO2 were measured at different sites inside each school during four months of the year 2020. In addition, a pre-designed questionnaire was used to evaluate the safety preparedness in the same selected schools. Results: Levels of the six air pollutants were higher inside schools adjacent to roads with moderate traffic activity than schools with low and very low traffic activity. However, the mean level of CO2 inside the selected schools was higher than its outdoor level, suggesting the predominance of an indoor source of CO2. Levels of all measured air pollutants inside governmental constructed school buildings were higher than those inside the rental type. Conclusion: The average levels of air pollutants inside the selected schools were much lower than their air quality guidelines (AQGs), while some CO2 and NO2 levels exceeded their AQGs at some schools.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Disease and viruses as negative factor prohibiting the growth of broiler chicken embryo as research topic trend: a bibliometric review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Broiler chickens have properties as meat-producing poultry and produce meat with soft fiber quality. Broiler’s embryo needs to be given attention, especially against disease. The purpose of the study was to observe the trend of the research topic and external factors which could affect the embryo’s growth of broiler. Methods This study used meta-data from Scopus. There were 162 samples started from 2006-to 2022. The data were analyzed using a bibliometric method with two software, Vosviewer, and Biblioshiy from R studio. Results It was found that the study of broiler chicken embryos had developed well, especially those related to genetics, disease, and also the immunity system. But the result showed that topics about the disease, viruses, and bacteria were more popular than topics about the gene. The result also showed that based on the importance and development of topics, the words such as “chicken”, “genes”, “development”, “effect”, growth”, and “control” had importance for the study and developed well in research. It means that genes influenced the growth of the embryo of a chicken. But still, even though a chicken gene was predetermined, the genetic engineering of chicken insemination to produce a superior breed with a fast-growing rate of the embryo could be used. Conclusions It could be stated that disease, especially research about the virus is one of the main determinants that could affect the growth of the embryo of broiler chicken.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dataset for the attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19 preventive measures in diverse settings of Mozambique: a qualitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this data note, we provide the details of a qualitative study database conducted before the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mozambique. During this period (from September 2020), several compulsory COVID-19 preventive measures were put forth as a response to the emerging pandemic in the country. Data were collected aiming to evaluate home confinement behaviours, household members’ mobility, and the mobility routes and other attitudes and practices related to COVID-19 preventive measures at the community level. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive, mixed method study was conducted involving adults from different regions in Mozambique. Data were collected using a combination of rapid ethnography and rapid rural assessment methods consisting of telephone-based semi-structured interviews, informal conversations, non-participant observations and short questionnaires. The COREQ guidelines for reporting qualitative studies were performed. Results: 295 semi-structured interviews (SSI) with adult household members were included in the study. Of these, 23 were conducted face-to-face and 272 by telephone, covering 24 districts and cities in 9 provinces. More than half (53.9%) of participants were females and aged 18 - 98 years old (median [interquartile range] = 35 [29-43]). Most had a relevant role in the household, with formal education and had to leave home for income generating. Conclusion: This data, available in our repository, favours several angles of assessments of behaviour related to home confinement, mobility and routes of a population group prior to the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for the perioperative outcome risk assessment with computer learning enhancement (Periop ORACLE) randomized study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: More than four million people die each year in the month following surgery, and many more experience complications such as acute kidney injury. Some of these outcomes may be prevented through early identification of at-risk patients and through intraoperative risk mitigation. Telemedicine has revolutionized the way at-risk patients are identified in critical care, but intraoperative telemedicine services are not widely used in anesthesiology. Clinicians in telemedicine settings may assist with risk stratification and brainstorm risk mitigation strategies while clinicians in the operating room are busy performing other patient care tasks. Machine learning tools may help clinicians in telemedicine settings leverage the abundant electronic health data available in the perioperative period. The primary hypothesis for this study is that anesthesiology clinicians can predict postoperative complications more accurately with machine learning assistance than without machine learning assistance. Methods: This investigation is a sub-study nested within the TECTONICS randomized clinical trial (NCT03923699). As part of TECTONICS, study team members who are anesthesiology clinicians working in a telemedicine setting are currently reviewing ongoing surgical cases and documenting how likely they feel the patient is to experience 30-day in-hospital death or acute kidney injury. For patients who are included in this sub-study, these case reviews will be randomized to be performed with access to a display showing machine learning predictions for the postoperative complications or without access to the display. The accuracy of the predictions will be compared across these two groups. Conclusion: Successful completion of this study will help define the role of machine learning not only for intraoperative telemedicine, but for other risk assessment tasks before, during, and after surgery. Registration: ORACLE is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05042804; registered September 13, 2021.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Librarian: A quality control tool to analyse sequencing library compositions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Robust analysis of DNA sequencing data needs to include a set of quality control steps to ensure that technical bias is kept to a minimum. A metric easily obtained is the frequency of each of the nucleobases for each position across all sequencing reads. Here, we explore the differences in nucleobase compositions of various library types produced by standard experimental methodologies.  Methods: We obtained the compositions of nearly 3000 publicly available datasets and subjected them to Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction for a two-dimensional representation of their composition characteristics.   Results: We find that most library types result in a specific composition profile. We use this to give an estimate of how strongly the composition of a test library resembles the profiles of previously published libraries, and how likely the test sample is to be of a particular type. We introduce Librarian, a user-friendly web application and command line tool which enables checking base compositions of test libraries against known library types.   Conclusions: Library preparation methods strongly influence the per position nucleobase content. By comparing test libraries to a database of previously published library types we can make predictions regarding the library preparation method. Librarian is a user-friendly tool to access this information for quality assurance purposes as discrepancies can flag potential irregularities very early on.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling enculturated bias in entrainment to rhythmic patterns</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas Kaplan, Jonathan Cannon, Lorenzo Jamone, Marcus Pearce</p>

Long-term and culture-specific experience of music shapes rhythm perception, leading to enculturated expectations that make certain rhythms easier to track and more conducive to synchronized movement. However, the influence of enculturated bias on the moment-to-moment dynamics of rhythm tracking is not well understood. Recent modeling work has formulated entrainment to rhythms as a formal inference problem, where phase is continuously estimated based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations: PIPPET (Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing). Here we propose that the problem of optimally tracking a rhythm also requires an ongoing process of inferring which pattern of event timing expectations is most suitable to predict a stimulus rhythm. We formalize this insight as an extension of PIPPET called pPIPPET (PIPPET with pattern inference). The variational solution to this problem introduces terms representing the likelihood that a stimulus is based on a particular member of a set of event timing patterns, which we initialize according to culturally-learned prior expectations of a listener. We evaluate pPIPPET in three experiments. First, we demonstrate that pPIPPET can qualitatively reproduce enculturated bias observed in human tapping data for simple two-interval rhythms. Second, we simulate categorization of a continuous three-interval rhythm space by Western-trained musicians through derivation of a comprehensive set of priors for pPIPPET from metrical patterns in a sample of Western rhythms. Third, we simulate iterated reproduction of three-interval rhythms, and show that models configured with notated rhythms from different cultures exhibit both universal and enculturated biases as observed experimentally in listeners from those cultures. These results suggest the influence of enculturated timing expectations on human perceptual and motor entrainment can be understood as approximating optimal inference about the rhythmic stimulus, with respect to prototypical patterns in an empirical sample of rhythms that represent the music-cultural environment of the listener.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Generative and interpretable machine learning for aptamer design and analysis of in vitro sequence selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrea Di Gioacchino, Jonah Procyk, Marco Molari, John S. Schreck, Yu Zhou, Yan Liu, Rémi Monasson, Simona Cocco, Petr Šulc</p>

Selection protocols such as SELEX, where molecules are selected over multiple rounds for their ability to bind to a target of interest, are popular methods for obtaining binders for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), an unsupervised two-layer neural network architecture, can successfully be trained on sequence ensembles from single rounds of SELEX experiments for thrombin aptamers. RBMs assign scores to sequences that can be directly related to their fitnesses estimated through experimental enrichment ratios. Hence, RBMs trained from sequence data at a given round can be used to predict the effects of selection at later rounds. Moreover, the parameters of the trained RBMs are interpretable and identify functional features contributing most to sequence fitness. To exploit the generative capabilities of RBMs, we introduce two different training protocols: one taking into account sequence counts, capable of identifying the few best binders, and another based on unique sequences only, generating more diverse binders. We then use RBMs model to generate novel aptamers with putative disruptive mutations or good binding properties, and validate the generated sequences with gel shift assay experiments. Finally, we compare the RBM’s performance with different supervised learning approaches that include random forests and several deep neural network architectures.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimation of the firing behaviour of a complete motoneuron pool by combining electromyography signal decomposition and realistic motoneuron modelling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arnault H. Caillet, Andrew T. M. Phillips, Dario Farina, Luca Modenese</p>

Our understanding of the firing behaviour of motoneuron (MN) pools during human voluntary muscle contractions is currently limited to electrophysiological findings from animal experiments extrapolated to humans, mathematical models of MN pools not validated for human data, and experimental results obtained from decomposition of electromyographical (EMG) signals. These approaches are limited in accuracy or provide information on only small partitions of the MN population. Here, we propose a method based on the combination of high-density EMG (HDEMG) data and realistic modelling for predicting the behaviour of entire pools of motoneurons in humans. The method builds on a physiologically realistic model of a MN pool which predicts, from the experimental spike trains of a smaller number of individual MNs identified from decomposed HDEMG signals, the unknown recruitment and firing activity of the remaining unidentified MNs in the complete MN pool. The MN pool model is described as a cohort of single-compartment leaky fire-and-integrate (LIF) models of MNs scaled by a physiologically realistic distribution of MN electrophysiological properties and driven by a spinal synaptic input, both derived from decomposed HDEMG data. The MN spike trains and effective neural drive to muscle, predicted with this method, have been successfully validated experimentally. A representative application of the method in MN-driven neuromuscular modelling is also presented. The proposed approach provides a validated tool for neuroscientists, experimentalists, and modelers to infer the firing activity of MNs that cannot be observed experimentally, investigate the neuromechanics of human MN pools, support future experimental investigations, and advance neuromuscular modelling for investigating the neural strategies controlling human voluntary contractions.

                <p>by Mohammad Salahshour</p>

In many biological populations, such as human groups, individuals face a complex strategic setting, where they need to make strategic decisions over a diverse set of issues and their behavior in one strategic context can affect their decisions in another. This raises the question of how the interaction between different strategic contexts affects individuals’ strategic choices and social norms? To address this question, I introduce a framework where individuals play two games with different structures and decide upon their strategy in a second game based on their knowledge of their opponent’s strategy in the first game. I consider both multistage games, where the same opponents play the two games consecutively, and reputation-based model, where individuals play their two games with different opponents but receive information about their opponent’s strategy. By considering a case where the first game is a social dilemma, I show that when the second game is a coordination or anti-coordination game, the Nash equilibrium of the coupled game can be decomposed into two classes, a defective equilibrium which is composed of two simple equilibrium of the two games, and a cooperative equilibrium, in which coupling between the two games emerge and sustain cooperation in the social dilemma. For the existence of the cooperative equilibrium, the cost of cooperation should be smaller than a value determined by the structure of the second game. Investigation of the evolutionary dynamics shows that a cooperative fixed point exists when the second game belongs to coordination or anti-coordination class in a mixed population. However, the basin of attraction of the cooperative fixed point is much smaller for the coordination class, and this fixed point disappears in a structured population. When the second game belongs to the anti-coordination class, the system possesses a spontaneous symmetry-breaking phase transition above which the symmetry between cooperation and defection breaks. A set of cooperation supporting moral norms emerges according to which cooperation stands out as a valuable trait. Notably, the moral system also brings a more efficient allocation of resources in the second game. This observation suggests a moral system has two different roles: Promotion of cooperation, which is against individuals’ self-interest but beneficial for the population, and promotion of organization and order, which is at both the population’s and the individual’s self-interest. Interestingly, the latter acts like a Trojan horse: Once established out of individuals’ self-interest, it brings the former with itself. Importantly, the fact that the evolution of moral norms depends only on the cost of cooperation and is independent of the benefit of cooperation implies that moral norms can be harmful and incur a pure collective cost, yet they are just as effective in promoting order and organization. Finally, the model predicts that recognition noise can have a surprisingly positive effect on the evolution of moral norms and facilitates cooperation in the Snow Drift game in structured populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Generalism drives abundance: A computational causal discovery approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chuliang Song, Benno I. Simmons, Marie-Josée Fortin, Andrew Gonzalez</p>

A ubiquitous pattern in ecological systems is that more abundant species tend to be more generalist; that is, they interact with more species or can occur in wider range of habitats. However, there is no consensus on whether generalism drives abundance (a selection process) or abundance drives generalism (a drift process). As it is difficult to conduct direct experiments to solve this chicken-and-egg dilemma, previous studies have used a causal discovery method based on formal logic and have found that abundance drives generalism. Here, we refine this method by correcting its bias regarding skewed distributions, and employ two other independent causal discovery methods based on nonparametric regression and on information theory, respectively. Contrary to previous work, all three independent methods strongly indicate that generalism drives abundance when applied to datasets on plant-hummingbird communities and reef fishes. Furthermore, we find that selection processes are more important than drift processes in structuring multispecies systems when the environment is variable. Our results showcase the power of the computational causal discovery approach to aid ecological research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sleep-promoting neurons remodel their response properties to calibrate sleep drive with environmental demands</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stephane Dissel, Markus K. Klose, Bruno van Swinderen, Lijuan Cao, Melanie Ford, Erica M. Periandri, Joseph D. Jones, Zhaoyi Li, Paul J. Shaw</p>

Falling asleep at the wrong time can place an individual at risk of immediate physical harm. However, not sleeping degrades cognition and adaptive behavior. To understand how animals match sleep need with environmental demands, we used live-brain imaging to examine the physiological response properties of the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) following interventions that modify sleep (sleep deprivation, starvation, time-restricted feeding, memory consolidation) in <i>Drosophila</i>. We report that dFB neurons change their physiological response-properties to dopamine (DA) and allatostatin-A (AstA) in response to different types of waking. That is, dFB neurons are not simply passive components of a hard-wired circuit. Rather, the dFB neurons intrinsically regulate their response to the activity from upstream circuits. Finally, we show that the dFB appears to contain a memory trace of prior exposure to metabolic challenges induced by starvation or time-restricted feeding. Together, these data highlight that the sleep homeostat is plastic and suggests an underlying mechanism.

                Background: Construction development in Indonesia is growing rapidly, especially in Central Aceh District. Construction projects often experience risks, so that risk events can have a serious impact on the viability of the project. Project delays can result in cost overruns and project losses. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the factors causing project delays.The purpose of this study was to (1) identify the risk factors that cause delays in construction projects and (2) determine those particular risk factors that have a greater influence on construction projects. The location of this research was Central Aceh District. Methods: The data in this study were primary data in the form of a questionnaire and secondary data obtained from the literature related to this particular type of research. Questionnaires were distributed to respondents, namely contractor companies located in the Central Aceh District. The questionnaires were distributed to determine respondents' opinions about the level of influence of risk factors causing project delays. We used a validity test, reliability test, and descriptive analysis for data processing. Results: Based on the results of the study from 47 respondents, the “very high influence” category (Mode=5) for the tool malfunction factor, cost estimation inaccuracy, increased work costs, implementation of new technologies, details, accuracy and conformity to specifications that are not appropriate, worker quarrels, poor project planning and management, poor condition at locations and accessibility difficulty. Conclusions: Of the 80 risk factors that caused project delays, eight risk factors were found to have a very high influence on the implementation of construction projects in Central Aceh District. Practical implications: The results of this study provide knowledge to contractor companies about the delay factors that have the most influence on project implementation so that they are expected to be able to manage risks to avoid losses.

                Antibiotics are frequently used to treat or prevent bacterial infections in humans, animals, and crops. Later, the drugs end up in the environment, particularly the water supply, through wastewater, excrement, or groundwater. Because testing for antibiotics in drinking water (even bottled water) is rare, people consume them unknowingly (1). Extensive human exposure to low-dose antibiotics can lead to decreased response to antibiotics when they are needed (2), and antimicrobial resistance is growing (3). Therefore, governments worldwide should work to identify, prevent, and remediate antibiotic contamination of water sources (4).

                The information and communications technology (ICT) industry, which includes telephone and computer networks and devices, has the potential to reduce emissions and increase efficiency in other industries by using internet platforms to connect equipment, production lines, factories, suppliers, products, and customers (1). The ICT industry is expected to help reduce global carbon emissions by 20% by 2030 (2). However, the industry’s own carbon emissions could undermine its positive contributions. Although carbon emissions produced by the ICT industry accounted for only about 1% of total global carbon emissions in 2007, without interventions, the number could reach 14% by 2040 (3). In China, where the ICT industry is growing rapidly (4), the government must ensure an environmentally responsible transition.

                Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global threat to humans and the world’s economy. Effective and safe vaccines against this virus are essential to control and eradicate the pandemic. The currently applied vaccines carry SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein mRNA/cDNA. These vaccines go through several cellular processes in the recipients for producing antigens. On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain)-protein is an antigen. It will directly stimulate antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we propose to produce SARS-CoV-2 RBD-protein as a fast acting, effective and safe vaccine.  Methods: We propose to reconstruct a plasmid carrying three types of  DNA sequences: RBD cDNA, FP (fusion peptide) DNA and sfGFP(superfolder-green-fluorescent-protein), cDNA creating the RBD-FP-sfGFP DNA within an orf (open-reading-frame). Escherichia coli, C2566H, transformed with the reconstructed plasmid will express RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein producing green fluorescent cfu (colony forming unit). The RBD-protein will be separated from the sfGFP using an FP specific enterokinase, and eluted by HIC (hydrophobic-interaction-chromatography), detected with a BioVision-Elisa-Kit, and quantified by spectrophotometry at UV280nm and immune simulation will be carried out using C57BL mice.  Results: The plasmid reconstruct will carry ampr (ampicillin-resistant) gene as a selective marker and a T7 promoter controlling the expression of RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The transformed Escherichia coli will efficiently express the RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The highly efficient sfGFP fused within the RBD-FP-sfGFP will produce green fluorescent cfu. The RBD-FP-sfGFP protein extract from the green cfu, digested by enterokinase and separated by the HIC will produce pure immunoreactive RBD protein.  Conclusion: A positive BioVision-ELISA test detects <10 pg RBD protein/ml of the sample. A larger sample of the purified RBD protein can be used as a vaccine following a standard formulation and safety protocols. Once administered, the RBD protein will stimulate antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The RBD protein has no potential to recombine with human genome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A flexible open-source processing workflow for multiplexed fluorescence imaging based on cycles [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Multiplexing tissue imaging is developing as a complement for single cell analysis, bringing the spatial information of cells in tissue in addition to multiple parameters measurements. More and more commercial or home-made systems are available. These techniques allow the imaging of tens of fluorescent reporters, where the spectral overlap is solved by imaging by cycles the fluorophores using microfluidics to change the reporters between each cycle. Methods For several systems, the acquisition system coupled to the microfluidic system is a wide field microscope, and the acquisition process is done by mosaicking to cover a large field of view, relying on image processing to obtain the data set to be analysed in intensity. The processed data set allows the identification of different populations, quite similarly to cytometry analysis, but with spatial information in addition. To obtain the final image for analysis from the raw acquisitions, several preprocessing steps are needed for inter-cycle registration, tissue autofluorescence correction or mosaicking. We propose a workflow for this preprocessing, implemented as an open source software (as a library, command line tool and standalone). Results We exemplify the workflow on the commercial system PhenoCycler® (formerly named CODEX®) and provide a reduced size data set for testing. Conclusions We compare our processor with the commercially provided processor and show that we solve some problems also reported by other users.

                Background: Dermatoglyphics can be utilised in clinical settings to identify those who are more likely to have impacted teeth. Additionally, dermatoglyphics looks to have potential as a non-invasive diagnostic method for predicting the presence or absence of an impacted tooth. The goal of this study was to look at the most common dermatoglyphic pattern in people who had or didn't have an impacted mandibular third molar teeth and see if there was a dermatoglyphic signature. Methods: A cross-sectional study with 180 participants was conducted (90 cases and 90 controls). The rolling impression technique was used to apply blue duplicating ink to participants' fingertips, which was then recorded. There was an increase in the frequency of the whorl-plain pattern in the right-hand ring finger (60%; p=0.028) and left-hand little finger (33.3%; p=0.009), as well as the loop-ulnar pattern in the right-hand middle finger (74.4%; p=0.024) in individuals with a predisposition to the presence of impacted teeth. Results: The left-hand little finger was found to be the most predictive for impaction in a forward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Dermatoglyphics could be used as a non-invasive sign to predict whether or not a tooth is affected. Its value comes in early detection, which helps to avoid the surgical problems that come with symptomatic extraction of an impacted tooth.

                Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare condition marked by uncontrolled histiocyte proliferation and activation, and phagocytosis of normal hematopoietic cells. This disease is rare, and a concurrent presentation with acute polymyositis is rare. A 14-year-old male was admitted to Chattogram Medical College Hospital with a high-grade fever for 25 days, generalized severe body aches, and multiple large joint pain in the lower limb for the same duration. On examination, the patient was found to have splenomegaly, tenderness in both knee joints, symmetrical proximal weakness of both lower limbs, several sensory losses, and loss of bowel and bladder control. The laboratory data showed that he had anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, hypoalbuminemia, raised D-dimer, and serum creatine phosphokinase (S. CPK). Along with these, a bone marrow biopsy revealed hemophagocytic cells, and he was diagnosed with HLH with acute polymyositis (PM). The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone and dexamethasone. Clinical stability was achieved with gradual improvement of initial symptoms and biochemical markers. The patient was discharged with oral steroids at a tapering dose and was advised to regularly follow-up.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of genetic factors in microtia: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microtia is a congenital malformation of the outer ears caused by improper embryonic development. The origin of microtia and causes of its variations remain unknown. Because of the lack of clarity regarding the role of genetic variables in microtia, we conducted a systematic review to qualitatively identify the genes most important in the development of microtia to provide an up-to-date review. Methods: Using six search engines, we searched all published studies related to the genetic factors of isolated microtia and syndromic microtia. The identified publications were screened and selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by the authors and assessed for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. We found 40 studies, including 22 studies on syndromic microtia and 18 studies on isolated microtia. Data extraction of each study was arranged in tabulation for syndromic and isolated microtia. The extracted data were: first author’s surname, year of publication, country of origin, study design, sample characteristic and gene assessed. Results: After the data were extracted, analyzed, and reviewed, the most common gene suspected to be involved in isolated microtia was Homeobox A2 (HOXA2, 12.1%). Conversely, in syndromic microtia, the two most common genes supposed to play a role were Fibroblast Growth Factor 3 (FGF3, 47.2%) and Treacher–Collins–Franceschetti syndrome 1 (TCOF1, 30.2%). From the studies, the three most prevalent genes associated with microtia were HOXA2 (10%), FGF3 (8.4%), and TCOF1 (5.4%). In syndromic microtia, the most common mutation types were deletion in TCOF1 (46.9%) and missense and deletion in FGF3 (both 38%), and in isolated microtia, the most common mutation type was silent in HOXA2 (54.2%). Conclusions: In summary, genetic factors are involved in microtia; thus, molecular analysis is strongly advised. PROSPERO registration: CRD42021287294 (25/10/21).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Study of bypassing Microsoft Windows Security using the MITRE CALDERA Framework [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microsoft Windows Security is a recently implemented safeguard for the Windows operating systems, including the latest versions of Windows10 and 11. However, there is a major shortcoming in this system to stop Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). These are government-financed groups that are funded to attack other government entities. Following the initial security breach, the hacked Windows device is used to access the rest of the network devices in order to transfer data to external storage (Exfiltration). Methods: In this work, we have tested the Microsoft Windows Security system using MITRE CALDERA and ATT&CK frameworks and explain how APT groups are able to bypass Windows Security. Results: In this study we used "54ndc47" agent through GoLang feature in MITRE CALDERA platform to test and bypass Microsoft Windows Security systems (MS Windows 10). Through it, we were able to bypass the Windows Security system and display entire files in the victim's device. Conclusions: In this paper, we have provided recommendations to Microsoft to improve their Windows Security tool through the use of Artificial intelligence (AI).

                Background: Magnesium alloy is not only light in weight but also possesses moderate strength. Magnesium AZ31-H24 alloy sheet has many applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. Experimental stretch forming tests are performed on this sheet to measure the material’s formability by constructing forming limit diagrams. Methods: Several tests of Nakazima were carried out on rectangular samples at 24, 250, 350°C and 0.01, 0.001 mm/s using a hemispherical punch. The work done to predict the formability of magnesium alloys has not been recorded in recent literature on machine learning models. Hence, the researchers of this article choose to explore the same and build three models to predict the formability of magnesium alloy through Random Forest algorithm, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Multiple linear Regression. Results: The Random Forest showed high accuracy of 96% in prediction. Conclusions: It is concluded that the need for physical experiments can be greatly minimized in formability studies by using machine learning concepts.

                The past three decades have seen a major shift in our understanding of the strong links between autism and identity. These developments have called for careful consideration of the language used to describe autism. Here, we briefly discuss some of these deliberations and provide guidance to researchers around language use in autism research.

                The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants that escape neutralization can jeopardize the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Chen et al. report the isolation of potent human antibodies that neutralize emerging variants of concern, including various Omicron sublineages. These antibodies show prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in the hamster model.

This facilitation determines which branches of sensory axons conduct action potentials to motor neurons, enabling computation at the level of the node to regulate sensory feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Candida albicans virulence factor candidalysin polymerizes in solution to form membrane pores and damage epithelial cells</a></h4>

              
                <i>Candida albicans</i> causes severe invasive candidiasis. <i>C. albicans</i> infection requires the virulence factor candidalysin (CL) which damages target cell membranes. However, the mechanism that CL uses to permeabilize membranes is unclear. We reveal that CL forms membrane pores using a unique mechanism. Unexpectedly, CL readily assembled into polymers in solution. We propose that the basic structural unit in polymer formation is a CL oligomer, which is sequentially added into a string configuration that can close into a loop. CL loops appear to spontaneously insert into the membrane to become pores. A CL mutation (G4W) inhibited the formation of polymers in solution and prevented pore formation in synthetic lipid systems. Epithelial cell studies showed that G4W CL failed to activate the danger response pathway, a hallmark of the pathogenic effect of CL. These results indicate that CL polymerization in solution is a necessary step for the damage of cellular membranes. Analysis of CL pores by atomic force microscopy revealed co-existence of simple depressions and more complex pores, which are likely formed by CL assembled in an alternate oligomer orientation. We propose that this structural rearrangement represents a maturation mechanism that stabilizes pore formation to achieve more robust cellular damage. To summarize, CL uses a previously unknown mechanism to damage membranes, whereby pre-assembly of CL loops in solution leads to formation of membrane pores. Our investigation not only unravels a new paradigm for the formation of membrane pores, but additionally identifies CL polymerization as a novel therapeutic target to treat candidiasis.

                In allergic asthma, allergen inhalation leads to local Th2 cell activation and peribronchial inflammation. However, the mechanisms for local antigen capture and presentation remain unclear. By two-photon microscopy of the mouse lung, we established that soluble antigens in the bronchial airway lumen were efficiently captured and presented by a population of CD11c<sup>+</sup> interstitial macrophages with high CX3CR1-GFP and MHC class II expression. We refer to these cells as Bronchus-Associated Macrophages (BAMs) based on their localization underneath the bronchial epithelium. BAMs were enriched in collagen-rich regions near some airway branchpoints, where inhaled antigens are likely to deposit. BAMs engaged in extended interactions with effector Th2 cells and promoted Th2 cytokine production. BAMs were also often in contact with dendritic cells (DCs). After exposure to inflammatory stimuli, DCs migrated to draining lymph nodes, whereas BAMs remained lung resident. We propose that BAMs act as local antigen presenting cells in the lung and also transfer antigen to DCs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Olfactory responses of Drosophila are encoded in the organization of projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                The projection neurons (PNs), reconstructed from electron microscope (EM) images of the Drosophila olfactory system, offer a detailed view of neuronal anatomy, providing glimpses into information flow in the brain. About 150 uPNs constituting 58 glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL) are bundled together in the axonal extension, routing the olfactory signal received at AL to mushroom body (MB) calyx and lateral horn (LH). Here we quantify the neuronal organization in terms of the inter-PN distances and examine its relationship with the odor types sensed by Drosophila. The homotypic uPNs that constitute glomeruli are tightly bundled and stereotyped in position throughout the neuropils, even though the glomerular PN organization in AL is no longer sustained in the higher brain center. Instead, odor-type dependent clusters consisting of multiple homotypes innervate the MB calyx and LH. Pheromone-encoding and hygro/thermo-sensing homotypes are spatially segregated in MB calyx, whereas two distinct clusters of food-related homotypes are found in LH in addition to the segregation of pheromone-encoding and hygro/thermo-sensing homotypes. We find that there are statistically significant associations between the spatial organization among a group of homotypic uPNs and certain stereotyped olfactory responses. Additionally, the signals from some of the tightly bundled homotypes converge to a specific group of lateral horn neurons (LHNs), which indicates that homotype (or odor type) specific integration of signals occurs at the synaptic interface between PNs and LHNs. Our findings suggest that before neural computation in the inner brain, some of the olfactory information are already encoded in the spatial organization of uPNs, illuminating that a certain degree of labeled-line strategy is at work in the Drosophila olfactory system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Macrophage innate training induced by IL-4 and IL-13 activation enhances OXPHOS driven anti-mycobacterial responses</a></h4>

              
                Macrophages are a highly adaptive population of innate immune cells. Polarization with IFNγ and LPS into the 'classically activated' M1 macrophage enhances pro-inflammatory and microbicidal responses, important for eradicating bacteria such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. By contrast, 'alternatively activated' M2 macrophages, polarized with IL-4, oppose bactericidal mechanisms and allow mycobacterial growth. These activation states are accompanied by distinct metabolic profiles, where M1 macrophages favor near exclusive use of glycolysis, whereas M2 macrophages up-regulate oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here we demonstrate that activation with IL-4 and IL-13 counterintuitively induces protective innate memory against mycobacterial challenge. In human and murine models, prior activation with IL-4/13 enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in response to a secondary stimulation with mycobacterial ligands. In our murine model, enhanced killing capacity is also demonstrated. Despite this switch in phenotype, IL-4/13 trained murine macrophages do not demonstrate M1-typical metabolism, instead retaining heightened use of OXPHOS. Moreover, inhibition of OXPHOS with oligomycin, 2-deoxy glucose or BPTES all impeded heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine responses from IL-4/13 trained macrophages. Lastly, this work identifies that IL-10 attenuates protective IL-4/13 training, impeding pro-inflammatory and bactericidal mechanisms. In summary, this work provides new and unexpected insight into alternative macrophage activation states in the context of mycobacterial infection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rabphilin 3A binds the N-peptide of SNAP-25 to promote SNARE complex assembly in exocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Exocytosis of secretory vesicles requires the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins and small GTPase Rabs. As a Rab3/Rab27 effector protein on secretory vesicles, Rabphilin 3A was implicated to interact with SNAP-25 to regulate vesicle exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we have characterized the physiologically relevant binding sites between Rabphilin 3A and SNAP-25. We found that an intramolecular interplay between the N-terminal Rab-binding domain and C-terminal C<sub>2</sub>AB domain enables Rabphilin 3A to strongly bind the SNAP-25 N-peptide region via its C<sub>2</sub>B bottom α-helix. Disruption of this interaction significantly impaired docking and fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane in rat PC12 cells. In addition, we found that this interaction allows Rabphilin 3A to accelerate SNARE complex assembly. Furthermore, we revealed that this interaction accelerates SNARE complex assembly via inducing a conformational switch from random coils to α-helical structure in the SNAP-25 SNARE motif. Altogether, our data suggest that the promotion of SNARE complex assembly by binding the C<sub>2</sub>B bottom α-helix of Rabphilin 3A to the N-peptide of SNAP-25 underlies a pre-fusion function of Rabphilin 3A in vesicle exocytosis.

                Pain is constructed through complex interactions among multiple brain systems, but it remains unclear how functional brain networks are reconfigured over time while experiencing pain. Here, we investigated the time-varying changes in the functional brain networks during 20 min capsaicin-induced sustained orofacial pain. In the early stage, the orofacial areas of the primary somatomotor cortex were separated from other areas of the somatosensory cortex and integrated with subcortical and frontoparietal regions, constituting an extended brain network of sustained pain. As pain decreased over time, the subcortical and frontoparietal regions were separated from this brain network and connected to multiple cerebellar regions. Machine-learning models based on these network features showed significant predictions of changes in pain experience across two independent datasets (<i>n</i> = 48 and 74). This study provides new insights into how multiple brain systems dynamically interact to construct and modulate pain experience, advancing our mechanistic understanding of sustained pain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Putting perception into action with inverse optimal control for continuous psychophysics</a></h4>

              
                Psychophysical methods are a cornerstone of psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience where they have been used to quantify behavior and its neural correlates for a vast range of mental phenomena. Their power derives from the combination of controlled experiments and rigorous analysis through signal detection theory. Unfortunately, they require many tedious trials and preferably highly trained participants. A recently developed approach, continuous psychophysics, promises to transform the field by abandoning the rigid trial structure involving binary responses and replacing it with continuous behavioral adjustments to dynamic stimuli. However, what has precluded wide adoption of this approach is that current analysis methods do not account for the additional variability introduced by the motor component of the task and therefore recover perceptual thresholds that are larger compared to equivalent traditional psychophysical experiments. Here, we introduce a computational analysis framework for continuous psychophysics based on Bayesian inverse optimal control. We show via simulations and previously published data that this not only recovers the perceptual thresholds but additionally estimates subjects’ action variability, internal behavioral costs, and subjective beliefs about the experimental stimulus dynamics. Taken together, we provide further evidence for the importance of including acting uncertainties, subjective beliefs, and, crucially, the intrinsic costs of behavior, even in experiments seemingly only investigating perception.

                A brain-computer interface that decodes continuous language from non-invasive recordings would have many scientific and practical applications. Currently, however, decoders that reconstruct continuous language use invasive recordings from surgically implanted electrodes, while decoders that use non-invasive recordings can only identify stimuli from among a small set of letters, words, or phrases. Here we introduce a non-invasive decoder that reconstructs continuous natural language from cortical representations of semantic meaning recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Given novel brain recordings, this decoder generates intelligible word sequences that recover the meaning of perceived speech, imagined speech, and even silent videos, demonstrating that a single language decoder can be applied to a range of semantic tasks. To study how language is represented across the brain, we tested the decoder on different cortical networks, and found that natural language can be separately decoded from multiple cortical networks in each hemisphere. As brain-computer interfaces should respect mental privacy, we tested whether successful decoding requires subject cooperation, and found that subject cooperation is required both to train and to apply the decoder. Our study demonstrates that continuous language can be decoded from non-invasive brain recordings, enabling future multipurpose brain-computer interfaces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development shaped by cue reliability in the barn owl's auditory midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems display capability to preferentially choose stimuli based on their reliability at conveying accurate information. While previous reports have shown the ability of the brain to reweigh cues based on ongoing or dynamic changes in reliability, how the brain may learn and maintain neural responses to sensory statistics expected to be stable over longer time periods remain significant open questions of potential mechanisms underlying naturalistic biased perception. This study provides evidence that the barn owl's midbrain is shaped by permanent statistics experienced during development. The barn owl's midbrain features a topographic map of auditory space where neurons compute horizontal sound location from the interaural time difference (ITD). Previous work has shown that frequency tuning of these midbrain map neurons is correlated with the pattern of most reliable frequencies for the neurons' preferred ITD. This pattern of ITD reliability is due to the filtering properties of the head, primarily determined by the facial ruff in the barn owl. In this study, we found that the absence of a facial ruff led to a decrease in the reliability of high frequencies originating from frontal space. To test if the owl's frequency tuning of midbrain map neurons is driven by permanent changes in the pattern of ITD reliability, these neurons were recorded from adult owls, who had the facial ruff removed as juveniles, and from juvenile owls, before the facial ruff developed. In both groups, we found that frontally-tuned neurons displayed tunings to frequencies lower than reported in normal adult owls, consistent with the difference in ITD reliability between the normal and ruff removed conditions. Juvenile owls also exhibited more heterogeneous frequency tuning, suggesting developmental processes that refine tuning to match the pattern of ITD reliability. Additional recordings immediately upstream of the midbrain map displayed ITD tuned neural responses for all frequencies across the owl's normal hearing range. Broader analysis of the effects of ruff-removal on the acoustical properties of spatial cues indicated a dominant role of ITD reliability in driving the adaptive changes in frequency tuning. These results support the hypothesis that frequency tuning in the midbrain map is developmentally adapted to permanent statistics of spatial cues, implementing probabilistic coding for sound localization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Incorporating natural language into vision models improves prediction and understanding of higher visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                We hypothesize that high-level visual representations contain more than the representation of individual categories: they represent complex semantic information inherent in scenes that is most relevant for interaction with the world. Consequently, multimodal models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) which construct image embeddings to best match embeddings of image captions should better predict neural responses in visual cortex, since image captions typically contain the most semantically relevant information in an image for humans. We extracted image features using CLIP, which encodes visual concepts with supervision from natural language captions. We then used voxelwise encoding models based on CLIP features to predict brain responses to real-world images from the Natural Scenes Dataset. CLIP explains up to R2=78% of variance in stimulus-evoked responses from individual voxels in the held out test data. CLIP also explains greater unique variance in higher-level visual areas compared to models trained only with image/label pairs (ImageNet trained ResNet) or text (BERT). Visualizations of model embeddings and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveal that, with the use of captions, CLIP captures both global and fine-grained semantic dimensions represented within visual cortex. Based on these novel results, we suggest that human understanding of their environment form an important dimension of visual representation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical somatostatin interneuron subtypes form cell-type specific circuits</a></h4>

              
                The cardinal interneuron classes are a useful simplification of cortical interneuron diversity, but such broad subgroupings glosses over the molecular, morphological, and circuit specificity of interneuron subtypes, most notably among the somatostatin interneuron class. The organizing principles by which the connectivity of these subtypes is specified are unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we designed a series of genetic strategies to target the breadth of somatostatin interneuron subtypes. Using these strategies to target three subtypes that span the entire cortical column, we examined their afferent and efferent connectivity. Our data demonstrated that each of these possesses remarkable reciprocal connectivity with the intracortical or corticofugal pyramidal classes, as well as parvalbumin interneurons. Even when two interneuron subtypes shared the same efferent target, their synaptic targeting proved selective for particular dendritic compartments. We thus provide evidence that subtypes of somatostatin cortical interneurons form cell-type specific cortical circuits.

	<p>Pain is often debilitating, and is associated with many pathologies, as either a cause or consequence. Pharmacological interventions, such as opioids, to manage pain may lead to potential problems, such as addiction. When pain is controlled and managed, it can prevent negative associated outcomes affiliated with disease. Music is a low-cost option that shows promise in the management of painful circumstances. Music therapy has provided potent options for pain relief across a variety of ages and populations. As a nonpharmacological alternative or complement lacking side effects, music interventions are growing in clinical application and research protocols. This article considers the neurological implications of varying kinds of pain to provide working considerations that preempt the use of music and music-therapy applications in treating pain.</p>

	<p>Background. After the declaration of the pandemic status in several countries, the continuity of face-to-face visits in psychiatric facilities has been delayed or even interrupted to reduce viral spread. Little is known about the personality factors associated with medication beliefs and adherence amongst individuals with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. This brief report describes a preliminary naturalistic longitudinal study that explored whether the Big Five personality traits prospectively moderate the effects of medication beliefs on changes in adherence during the pandemic for a group of outpatients with psychosis or bipolar disorder. Methods. Thirteen outpatients undergoing routine face-to-face follow-up assessments during the pandemic were included (41 observations overall) and completed the Revised Italian Version of the Ten-Item Personality Inventory, the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale&amp;amp;mdash;8-item and the Beck Depression Inventory&amp;amp;mdash;II. Results. Participants had stronger concerns about their psychiatric medications rather than beliefs about their necessity, and adherence to medications was generally low. Participants who had more necessity beliefs than concerns had better adherence to medications. People scoring higher in Conscientiousness and Neuroticism traits and more concerned about the medication side effects had poorer adherence. Conclusions. These preliminary data suggest the importance of a careful assessment of the adherence to medications amongst people with psychosis/bipolar disorder during the pandemic. Interventions aimed to improve adherence might focus on patients&amp;amp;rsquo; medication beliefs and their Conscientiousness and Neuroticism personality traits.</p>

	<p>The paper proposes an ecological and portable protocol for the large-scale collection of reading data in high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children based on recording the finger movements of a subject reading a text displayed on a tablet touchscreen. By capitalizing on recent evidence that movements of a finger that points to a scene or text during visual exploration or reading may approximate eye fixations, we focus on recognition of written content and function words, pace of reading, and accuracy in reading comprehension. The analysis showed significant differences between typically developing and ASD children, with the latter group exhibiting greater variation in levels of reading ability, slower developmental pace in reading speed, less accurate comprehension, greater dependency on word length and word frequency, less significant prediction-based processing, as well as a monotonous, steady reading pace with reduced attention to weak punctuation. Finger-tracking patterns provides evidence that ASD readers may fail to integrate single word processing into major syntactic structures and lends support to the hypothesis of an impaired use of contextual information to predict upcoming stimuli, suggesting that difficulties in perception may arise as difficulties in prediction.</p>

	<p>Humans constantly calibrate their sensorimotor system to accommodate environmental changes, and this perception-action integration is extensively studied using sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. The cerebellum is one of the key brain regions for sensorimotor adaptation, but previous attempts to modulate sensorimotor adaptation with cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) produced inconsistent findings. Since both conscious/explicit learning and procedural/implicit learning are involved in adaptation, researchers have proposed that ctDCS only affects sensorimotor adaptation when implicit learning dominates the overall adaptation. However, previous research had both types of learning co-exist in their experiments without controlling their potential interaction under the influence of ctDCS. Here, we used error clamp perturbation and gradual perturbation, two effective techniques to elicit implicit learning only, to test the ctDCS effect on sensorimotor adaptation. We administrated ctDCS to independent groups of participants while they implicitly adapted to visual errors. In Experiment 1, we found that cerebellar anodal tDCS had no effect on implicit adaptation induced by error clamp. In Experiment 2, we applied both anodal and cathodal stimulation and used a smaller error clamp to prevent a potential ceiling effect, and replicated the null effect. In Experiment 3, we used gradually imposed visual errors to elicit implicit adaptation but still found no effect of anodal tDCS. With a total of 174 participants, we conclude that the previous inconsistent tDCS effect on sensorimotor adaptation cannot be explained by the relative contribution of implicit learning. Given that the cerebellum is simultaneously involved in explicit and implicit learning, our results suggest that the complex interplay between the two learning processes and large individual differences associated with this interplay might contribute to the inconsistent findings from previous studies on ctDCS and sensorimotor adaptation.</p>

	<p>The link between emotions and motor function has been known for decades but is still not clarified. The Adaptive Force (AF) describes the neuromuscular capability to adapt to increasing forces and was suggested to be especially vulnerable to interfering inputs. This study investigated the influence of pleasant and unpleasant food imagery on the manually assessed AF of elbow and hip flexors objectified by a handheld device in 12 healthy women. The maximal isometric AF was significantly reduced during unpleasant vs. pleasant imagery and baseline (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, dz = 0.98&amp;amp;ndash;1.61). During unpleasant imagery, muscle lengthening started at 59.00 &amp;amp;plusmn; 22.50% of maximal AF, in contrast to baseline and pleasant imagery, during which the isometric position could be maintained mostly during the entire force increase up to ~97.90 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.00% of maximal AF. Healthy participants showed an immediately impaired holding function triggered by unpleasant imagery, presumably related to negative emotions. Hence, AF seems to be suitable to test instantaneously the effect of emotions on motor function. Since musculoskeletal complaints can result from muscular instability, the findings provide insights into the understanding of the causal chain of linked musculoskeletal pain and mental stress. A case example (current stress vs. positive imagery) suggests that the approach presented in this study might have future implications for psychomotor diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>

	<p>Introduction. The focus of the present paper is on (1) how dyslexia research and hence definitions have developed during the period 1950&amp;amp;ndash;2020 and includes (2) a database search of scientific publications on dyslexia during the same period. The focus is on the definitions of dyslexia and the organization of the network search based on the causal four-level model by Morton and Frith. Method. (1) The definitions are presented in accordance with a historic review of dyslexia research from 1950 to 2020 and based on (2) Google Scholar counts of publications on dyslexia, on defining dyslexia, on dyslexia at the four levels (symptomatic, cognitive, biological, environmental), and by areas (sensorimotor, comorbidity). Finally, a percentage calculation shows the relative development within each level and area by decennium (1950&amp;amp;ndash;1960, 1960&amp;amp;ndash;1970, 1970&amp;amp;ndash;1980, 1990&amp;amp;ndash;2000, 2002&amp;amp;ndash;2010, 2010&amp;amp;ndash;2020). Results. (1) Of the seven definitions presented, only the definition by the BDA 2007 included the four levels of the causal model. (2) The number of publications increased substantially over the period. However, relatively few publications have defined dyslexia. An increase in publications from 1950 to 2020 was seen across the four levels and two areas&amp;amp;mdash;however, with an alteration in the thematic focus over this time span. Summary. Defining dyslexia has still not reached a consensus. This uncertainty may explain why only one of the seven definitions proved satisfactory according to the four-level model. Along with the general increase in research, publications on dyslexia have increased accordingly during the period 1950 to 2020. Although the symptomatic level has played a dominant role over the whole period, thematic shifts have been seen over these 70 years. In particular, a substantial thematic shift was seen by the turn of the millennium. There has been a relative increase in the focus on literacy at the symptomatic level, on phonological awareness at the cognitive level, in gender at the biological level, and second language learning as comorbidities. However, increases in counts are not alone a valid indication of scientific progress. In particular, the lack of definitional criteria as a basis for participant and method selection should attract much more focus in future studies. The present study underlines the multifactorial nature of dyslexia, as evidenced by a substantial increase in the number of publications on the subject. It is a challenge for future research to continuously use and possibly redefine dyslexia definitions in line with such standards.</p>

	<p>Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles that contain a variety of mRNAs, miRNAs, and proteins. They are capable of being released by a variety of cells and are essential for cell&amp;amp;ndash;cell communication. The exosomes produced by cells have shown protective benefits against spinal cord damage (SCI). Recently, it was discovered that M2 macrophages aid in the angiogenesis of numerous illnesses. However, the functional role of M2 macrophage-derived exosomes on SCI is unclear. Here, we investigate the pro-angiogenesis of M2 macrophage-derived exosomes on SCI. We founded that M2 macrophage exosomes alleviated tissue damage and enhanced functional recovery post-SCI. We discovered that M2 macrophage exosome administration increased angiogenesis after SCI in vivo using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence labeling, and Western blot analysis. Additionally, the expression of the pro-angiogenesis factors, HIF-1&amp;amp;alpha; and VEGF, were enhanced with the treatment of the M2 macrophage exosomes. Furthermore, we found that M2 macrophage exosomes enhanced neurogenesis after SCI in vivo. In vitro, we found that M2 macrophage exosomes can be taken up by the brain endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) and that they enhanced the tube formation, migration, and proliferation of bEnd.3 cells. Furthermore, by using special siRNA to inhibit HIF-1&amp;amp;alpha; expression, we observed that the expression of VEGF decreased, and the tube formation, migration, and proliferation of bEnd.3 cells were attenuated with the treatment of HIF-1&amp;amp;alpha;-siRNA. In conclusion, our findings reveal that M2 macrophage exosomes improve neurological functional recovery and angiogenesis post-SCI, and this process is partially associated with the activation of the HIF-1/VEGF signaling pathway.</p>

	<p>Background: Wandering among people with dementia (PwD) is associated with a high risk of injury and death. The stigma of dementia prevents Chinese dementia families from seeking information and support earlier, which increases the demand for long-term care facilities. Despite universal recognition of the importance of care facilities, healthcare providers in care facilities still lack the relevant nursing knowledge and skills, including non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) that have been proven to be effective in preventing wandering. Systematic and culturally appropriate NPI programmes for healthcare providers to manage wandering among PwD in long-term care facilities are still lacking. We aimed to develop an evidence-based and culturally appropriate NPI programme for wandering in PwD to guide healthcare providers in nursing homes to prevent wandering and its adverse outcomes. Methods: The NPI programme was developed according to the framework of the Belgian Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBAM). We, (1) performed a systematic literature search to summarize the available evidence, (2) developed evidence-based recommendations for the NPI programme based on the existing evidence, and (3) carried out a validation process to revise the content of the recommendations and to determine the grades of recommendations, including group meetings with experts and a survey for end-users. Results: Based on 22 publications and validation from 7 experts and 76 end users, we developed 21 recommendations covering 4 domains: (1) caregiver education, (2) preventing excessive wandering, (3) promoting safe walking, and (4) preventing people with dementia from going missing. We created almost all recommendations of the four domains with accompanying levels of evidence and grades of recommendations. Conclusions: By combining the evidence with expert and end-user opinions, a comprehensive NPI programme was developed to support institutional healthcare providers to prevent wandering and its adverse outcomes. The benefits of this programme are currently being tested.</p>

	<p>Parental behavior problems have long-term effects on children&amp;amp;rsquo;s limbic brain structures and functions. Parental behavior problems-related brain changes in children may lead to mental disorders and behavior dysfunction later in life. However, our understanding of the relationship between parental behavior and children&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain structures is less obvious when children and adolescents are studied in a general population without mental disorders. The majority of studies on the relationship between parental behavior and adolescent brain structure have been focused on severe forms of the following parental behavior problems: (1) internalizing behavior associated with mood and anxiety disorders, and (2) externalizing behavior associated with substance use and violence. A few studies examined the effect of normative variations or subtle differences in parental behavior. Therefore, we utilized a large study&amp;amp;mdash;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)&amp;amp;mdash;to determine relationships between normative variation in parental internalizing and externalizing behavior and limbic brain structures in children and adolescents without mental disorders. Quantile (median) regression models were used to compute associations between parental behavior and children&amp;amp;rsquo;s limbic structures. We found that parental internalizing and externalizing behaviors are uniquely associated with children&amp;amp;rsquo;s limbic structures after adjustment for biological confounders and parental socioeconomic status. Our findings indicate that normative parental behavior may have a significant early influence on limbic structures of normally developing children and adolescents. Accelerated or delayed limbic structure maturation may account for children&amp;amp;rsquo;s and adolescents&amp;amp;rsquo; behavioral inadequacies and a risk of developing specific mood disorders or substance abuse problems later in life.</p>

	<p>The &amp;amp;ldquo;cocktail party&amp;amp;rdquo; problem&amp;amp;mdash;how a listener perceives speech in noisy environments&amp;amp;mdash;is typically studied using speech (multi-talker babble) or noise maskers. However, realistic cocktail party scenarios often include background music (e.g., coffee shops, concerts). Studies investigating music&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects on concurrent speech perception have predominantly used highly controlled synthetic music or shaped noise, which do not reflect naturalistic listening environments. Behaviorally, familiar background music and songs with vocals/lyrics inhibit concurrent speech recognition. Here, we investigated the neural bases of these effects. While recording multichannel EEG, participants listened to an audiobook while popular songs (or silence) played in the background at a 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Songs were either familiar or unfamiliar to listeners and featured either vocals or isolated instrumentals from the original audio recordings. Comprehension questions probed task engagement. We used temporal response functions (TRFs) to isolate cortical tracking to the target speech envelope and analyzed neural responses around 100 ms (i.e., auditory N1 wave). We found that speech comprehension was, expectedly, impaired during background music compared to silence. Target speech tracking was further hindered by the presence of vocals. When masked by familiar music, response latencies to speech were less susceptible to informational masking, suggesting concurrent neural tracking of speech was easier during music known to the listener. These differential effects of music familiarity were further exacerbated in listeners with less musical ability. Our neuroimaging results and their dependence on listening skills are consistent with early attentional-gain mechanisms where familiar music is easier to tune out (listeners already know the song&amp;amp;rsquo;s expectancies) and thus can allocate fewer attentional resources to the background music to better monitor concurrent speech material.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuroscience Milestones: Developing Standardized Core-Competencies for Research-Based Neuroscience Trainees</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the medical field, the implementation of Milestones by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has provided a common understanding among clinical and academic supervisors and trainees related to the development of core competencies during graduate medical training. These Milestones help establish developmental trajectories and aspirational goals for the trainee. Unfortunately, training in graduate and postgraduate neuroscience lacks a standardized developmental progression of competencies or outcomes expected of trainees. Without such standardizations, it may be difficult for both the mentor and trainee to identify levels of improvement, which may impact the trainee's future success. Here, we discuss the value of developing a nonexhaustive framework that may be used to evaluate trainees with the expectation that it will provide a template to help with the development of future neuroscientists.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Glycerol-3-Phosphate Shuttle Is a Backup System Securing Metabolic Flexibility in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electrical activity in neurons is highly energy demanding and accompanied by rises in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in turn, secures energy supply by pushing mitochondrial metabolism either through augmented NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) transfer into mitochondria via the malate&ndash;aspartate shuttle (MAS) or via direct activation of dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle after passing into the matrix through the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU). Another Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive booster of mitochondrial ATP synthesis is the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle (G3PS), whose role in neuronal energy supply has remained elusive. Essential components of G3PS are expressed in hippocampal neurons. Single neuron metabolic measurements in primary hippocampal cultures derived from rat pups of either sex reveal only moderate, if any, constitutive activity of G3PS. However, during electrical activity neurons fully rely on G3PS when MAS and MCU are unavailable. Under these conditions, G3PS is required for appropriate action potential firing. Accordingly, G3PS safeguards metabolic flexibility of neurons to cope with energy demands of electrical signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are known to provide a link between the energy-demanding electrical activity and an adequate ATP supply in neurons. To do so, Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts both from outside and inside of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Neuronal function critically depends on this regulation, and its defects are often found in various neurologic disorders. Although interest in neuronal metabolism has increased, many aspects thereof have remained unresolved. In particular, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) shuttling system, the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, has been largely ignored with respect to its function in neurons. Our results demonstrate that this shuttle is functional in hippocampal neurons and safeguards ATP supply and appropriate action potential firing when malate aspartate shuttle and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter are unavailable, thereby ensuring neuronal metabolic flexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Antagonistic Activities of Fmn2 and ADF Regulate Axonal F-Actin Patch Dynamics and the Initiation of Collateral Branching</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interstitial collateral branching of axons is a critical component in the development of functional neural circuits. Axon collateral branches are established through a series of cellular processes initiated by the development of a specialized, focal F-actin network in axons. The formation, maintenance and remodeling of this F-actin patch is critical for the initiation of axonal protrusions that are subsequently consolidated to form a collateral branch. However, the mechanisms regulating F-actin patch dynamics are poorly understood. Fmn2 is a formin family member implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. We find that Fmn2 regulates the initiation of axon collateral protrusions in chick spinal neurons and in zebrafish motor neurons. Fmn2 localizes to the protrusion-initiating axonal F-actin patches and regulates the lifetime and size of these F-actin networks. The F-actin nucleation activity of Fmn2 is necessary for F-actin patch stability but not for initiating patch formation. We show that Fmn2 insulates the F-actin patches from disassembly by the actin-depolymerizing factor, ADF, and promotes long-lived, larger patches that are competent to initiate axonal protrusions. The regulation of axonal branching can contribute to the neurodevelopmental pathologies associated with Fmn2 and the dynamic antagonism between Fmn2 and ADF may represent a general mechanism of formin-dependent protection of Arp2/3-initiated F-actin networks from disassembly.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Axonal branching is a key process in the development of functional circuits and neural plasticity. Axon collateral branching is initiated by the elaboration of F-actin filaments from discrete axonal F-actin networks. We show that the neurodevelopmental disorder-associated formin, Fmn2, is a critical regulator of axon collateral branching. Fmn2 localizes to the collateral branch-inducing F-actin patches in axons and regulates the stability of these actin networks. The F-actin nucleation activity of Fmn2 protects the patches from ADF-mediated disassembly. Opposing activities of Fmn2 and ADF exert a dynamic regulatory control on axon collateral branch initiation and may underly the neurodevelopmental defects associated with Fmn2.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Offset Responses in the Auditory Cortex Show Unique History Dependence</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory responses typically vary depending on the recent history of sensory experience. This is essential for processes, including adaptation, efficient coding, and change detection. In the auditory cortex (AC), the short-term history dependence of sound-evoked (onset) responses has been well characterized. Yet many AC neurons also respond to sound terminations, and little is known about the history dependence of these "offset" responses, whether the short-term dynamics of onset and offset responses are correlated, or how these properties are distributed among cell types. Here we presented awake male and female mice with repeating noise burst stimuli while recording single-unit activity from primary AC. We identified parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons through optotagging, and also separated narrow-spiking from broad-spiking units. We found that offset responses are typically less depressive than onset responses, and this result was robust to a variety of stimulus parameters, controls, measurement types, and selection criteria. Whether a cell's onset response facilitates or depresses does not predict whether its offset response facilitates or depresses. Cell types differed in the dynamics of their onset responses, and in the prevalence, but not the dynamics, of their offset responses. Finally, we clustered cells according to spiking responses and found that response clusters were associated with cell type. Each cluster contained cells of several types, but even within a cluster, cells often showed cell type-specific response dynamics. We conclude that onset and offset responses are differentially influenced by recent sound history, and discuss the implications of this for the encoding of ongoing sound stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory neuron responses depend on stimulus history. This history dependence is crucial for sensory processing, is precisely controlled at individual synapses and circuits, and is adaptive to the specific requirements of different sensory systems. In the auditory cortex, neurons respond to sound cessation as well as to sound itself, but how history dependence is used along this separate, "offset" information stream is unknown. We show that offset responses are more facilitatory than sound responses, even in neurons where sound responses depress. In contrast to sound onset responses, offset responses are absent in many cells, are relatively homogeneous, and show no cell type-specific differences in history dependence. Offset responses thus show unique response dynamics, suggesting their unique functions.</p>
